    "title": "Albania votes as PM Rama seeks fourth term",
    "content": "TIRANA, May 10 (Reuters) - Albania holds parliamentary elections on Sunday in which prime minister Edi Rama is seeking an unprecedented fourth term in office after a campaign dominated by promises to join the European Union and accusations of widespread graft. Rama, in power as head of the Socialist Party since 2013, is favourite to win against his old rival, former prime minister Sali Berisha of the Democratic Party, bolstered in part by Rama's control over state institutions, a recent period of healthy economic growth and a largely popular image abroad. Butopposition to Ramahas intensified in the past year over a perceived crackdown on the opposition, including Berisha, while Rama weathered aseries of scandalsof his own. These include the arrest of his ally, the mayor of Tirana Erion Veliaj, this year on allegations of corruption and money laundering. Veliaj and Berisha deny wrongdoing. Rama has spent the last week reiterating his promise to join the EU by the end of the decade. \"We will get our fourth mandate, and we will not lose a single day for Albania 2030 in the EU,\" he said at his final campaign rally on Friday. Still, many young voters especially are tired of the likes of Berisha and Rama who have run the country in various roles since the fall of communism in 1990. Polls show Rama with a commanding lead over Berisha, who has been weakened by graft charges. But his party may need help from smaller parties to maintain a slim four-seat majority. Polling stations open at 7 a.m. (0500 GMT) and close at 7 p.m. Results are expected on Monday. “I will vote for new politicians because those like Rama and Berisha have been here for three decades and they only replace themselves,” said Arber Qazimi, 21. An economics student called Erisa said she would not even vote and was instead looking for a way to join the hundreds of thousands of Albanians who have emigrated over the past decade, many of them to nearby EU countries. “I am only thinking how to go out of the country to study and then stay there and never come back,” she said. By some measures, Rama has done well. Annual economic growth above 4% for 2022-2024, driven by trade with the EU and a tourism boom, outstripped other Balkan countries, the World Bank says. But corruption remains a huge problem, experts say, driven by criminal gangs who make billions of euros from drugs and weapons trafficking overseas and bring it back to Albania to be laundered.",

    "title": "Australian Della Maddalena dethrones welterweight champ Muhammad at UFC 315",
    "content": "MONTREAL, Canada, May 11 (Reuters) - Australian Jack Della Maddalena outstruck Belal Muhammad to claim the UFC welterweight championship by unanimous decision in the early hours of Sunday, after a climactic final-round scramble left Muhammad bloodied from a knee strike. Perth-born Della Maddalena, who has a boxing background, thwarted several takedown attempts from Muhammad, the superior wrestler, to keep most of the fight on the feet as he claimed his 18th professional win in a row, handing the American his first loss in six years. \"He brings the pressure... I knew I had to be sharp on my feet,\" Della Maddalena said. \"I wanted to take him out of there. I was gunning for a finish but Belal is a tough dude.\" Della almost caught Muhammad with an early knee up the middle but missed, as the American replied with a punch and a head kick. A double jab-body kick combination from Della Maddalena frustrated Muhammad, who answered with a left hook before the Australian landed powerful straights. \"You are winning, he doesn't have a clue what to do right now,\" Della Maddalena's corner told him after the third round, while Muhammad's coaches implored him to go for the finish. Muhammad led with a flurry of straights and jabs, and tried to hide his takedown attempt behind an uppercut. But Della Maddalena managed to stay on the feet, while Muhammad landed kicks near the fence. \"Five more minutes to realise all your dreams,\" Della Maddalena's corner told him going into the final round. Della Maddalena cut Muhammad open with a knee but the American, not willing to give up, pushed the pace and landed a hook followed by a takedown, trying to finish the Australian with ground strikes. But Della Maddalena got up, and unloaded on Muhammad with big punches to the head and body as they both went for a finish until the clock ran out, giving the Australian the win (48-47, 48-47, 49-46). Della Maddalena, 28, said he wanted to face lightweight champion Islam Makhachev, who had taken the belt from Australian champion Alexander Volkanovski. \"I think it’s a beautiful challenge. He's the pound-for-pound number one. I want to get him back for Volk,\" Della Maddalena said. In the co-main event, Kyrgyzstan's Valentina Shevchenko defended her flyweight belt with a unanimous decision over Manon Fiorot, who suffered her first loss after 12 straight wins. Shevchenko's right hooks left Fiorot's nose bleeding in the first round, but the Frenchwoman fought back, pinning Shevchenko to the cage and landing knees from the clinch over the next two rounds. But Shevchenko escaped a body lock in the fourth round and knocked Fiorot down, before landing a spinning backfist and a superwoman punch in the fifth and final round to ensure a 48-47 victory on all three judges' scorecards.",

The world's top oil exporter reported net profit of 97.54 billion riyals ($26.01 billion) in the three months ended March 31. That beat a company-provided median estimate from 16 analysts of $25.36 billion. Aramco confirmed a previously outlined $21.36 billion in total dividends for the first quarter, $219 million of which was performance-linked dividends, a mechanism introduced after a windfall from oil prices in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Aramco had said in March it expected to declare total dividends of $85.4 billion in 2025, down sharply from last year's payout of over $124 billion, which was based on 2023 and 2024 earnings. The performance-linked payout, which last year totalled $43.1 billion, was slashed roughly 98% as free cash flow dried up. Free cash flow was $19.2 billion in the first quarter, down 15.8% from a year ago. \"Global trade dynamics affected energy markets in the first quarter of 2025, with economic uncertainty impacting oil prices,\" Chief Executive Amin Nasser said in a statement, adding Aramco's results showed the value of its low-cost operations. \"Such periods also highlight the importance of disciplined capital planning and execution while we continue to take a long-term view. In volatile times Aramco’s resilience underpins both our financial performance and our sustainable and progressive base dividend.\" Capital expenditure was just over $12.5 billion in the first quarter, up 15.9% from a year before.

    "title": "Padres wear out Rockies in 21-run, 24-hit attack",
    "content": "May 11 - Gavin Sheets crushed a two-run homer in the first inning to spark San Diego's 24-hit attack, and the Padres routed the slumping Colorado Rockies 21-0 on Saturday night in Denver. In the Padres' largest margin of victory in franchise history, Fernando Tatis Jr., Xander Bogaerts, Jake Cronenworth and Jason Heyward also homered. Jackson Merrill had four hits, and Elias Diaz and Luis Arraez had three hits apiece to help back Stephen Kolek (2-0), who tossed a complete-game shutout in his second major league start. Kolek, who appeared in 42 games as a rookie reliever in 2024, gave up five hits and struck out seven. His only stress came in the sixth inning when Colorado had first and third with one out, but he got Hunter Goodman to hit into an inning-ending double play. The Padres set a season high for runs and hits for the second straight night after Friday's 13-9 win in Denver on 16 hits. Every position player except for reserve left fielder Brandon Lockridge (0 for 1 with a walk) had at least a hit on Saturday, and eight had more than one. San Diego's 24 hits tied a franchise record. Colorado has dropped eight in a row, including five straight on its homestand that ends Sunday. The Rockies have been outscored 63-18 in the five games. The Padres jumped out to a lead in the first. Tatis and Manny Machado walked to put two runners on with one out. Merrill followed with an RBI single, Bogaerts loaded the bases with an infield hit and Machado scored on a wild pitch. Cronenworth's groundout brought home another run and Sheets hit a 439-foot homer into the stands in right to make it 5-0. San Diego tacked on a run in the second on Arraez's RBI single, then Cronenworth homered leading off the third, and Heyward's three-run homer in the fourth ended Bradley Blalock's night. Blalock (0-2) allowed 12 runs on 13 hits in 3 2/3 innings to balloon his ERA from 8.03 to 12.94. The Padres kept adding runs against Juan Meija in the fourth. Diaz walked, Tatis singled, both came home on Arraez's triple, and he scored on a Machado single. San Diego's eight-run inning was a season high, as were the eight hits in the fourth. Tatis hit a three-run blast in the fifth, his team-leading ninth of the season, to cap the four-run frame that opened with Bogaerts' homer. Colorado catcher Jacob Stallings pitched the final two innings and yielded one run on two hits with no walks and one strikeout. --Field Level Media",

    "title": "Putin proposes direct peace talks with Ukraine after three years of war",
    "content": "MOSCOW, May 11 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday proposed direct talks with Ukraine on May 15 in Turkey that he said should be aimed at bringing a durable peace, an initiative welcomed by U.S. President Donald Trump. Putin sent thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022, unleashinga warthat has left hundreds of thousands of soldiers dead and triggering the gravest confrontation between Russia and the West since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. The Russian leader, who has offered few concessions towards ending the conflict so far, said the talks in the Turkish city of Istanbul will be aimed at eliminating the root causes of the war and restoring a \"long-term, lasting peace\" rather than simply a pause for rearmament. \"We are proposing that Kyiv resume direct negotiations without any preconditions,\" Putin said from the Kremlin in the early hours of Sunday. \"We offer the Kyiv authorities to resume negotiations already on Thursday, in Istanbul.\" Putin said that he would speak to Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan later on Sunday about facilitating the talks, which he said could lead to a ceasefire. \"Our proposal, as they say, is on the table. The decision is now up to the Ukrainian authorities and their curators, who are guided, it seems, by their personal political ambitions, and not by the interests of their peoples.\" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's office and Ukraine's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment on the proposal. In a message on the social network Truth Social, Trump hailed Putin's proposal as a positive for ending the war. \"A potentially great day for Russia and Ukraine!\" Trump said. \"Think of the hundreds of thousands of lives that will be saved as this never ending 'bloodbath' hopefully comes to an end.\" Putin's proposal for direct talks with Ukraine came hours aftermajor European powersdemanded on Saturday in Kyiv that Putin agree to an unconditional 30-day ceasefire or face \"massive\" new sanctions. Putin dismissed what he said was the attempt by some European powers to lay down \"ultimatums\". Russia, Putin said, had proposed several ceasefires, including a moratorium on striking energy facilities, an Easter ceasefire and most recently the 72-hour truce during the celebrations marking 80 years since victory in World War Two. Both Russia and Ukraine accused each other of violating the temporary truce proposals,includingthe May 8-10 ceasefire. Despite Putin's call for peace talks, Russia on Sunday launched a droneattack on Kyivand other parts of Ukraine, injuring one person in the region surrounding the Ukrainian capital and damaging several private homes, Ukrainian officials said. Putin said that he does not rule out that during his proposed talks in Turkey both sides will agree on \"some new truces, a new ceasefire,\" but one that would be the first step towards a \"sustainable\" peace. Putin, whose forces have advanced over the past year, has stood firm in his conditions for ending the war despite public and private pressure from Trump and repeated warnings from European powers. In June 2024, he said that Ukraine must officially drop its NATO ambitions and withdraw its troops from the entirety of the territory of four Ukrainian regions claimed by Russia. Russian officials have also proposed that the U.S. recognise Russia's control over about one-fifth of Ukraine and demanded that Ukraine remains neutral though Moscow has said it is not opposed to Kyiv's ambitions to join the European Union. Putin specifically mentioned the 2022 draft deal which Russia and Ukraine negotiated shortly after the Russian invasion started. Under that draft, a copy of which Reuters has seen, Ukraine should agree to permanent neutrality in return for international security guarantees from the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council: Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States. \"It was not Russia that broke off negotiations in 2022. It was Kyiv,\" Putin said. \"Russia is ready to negotiate without any preconditions.\" He thanked China, Brazil, African and Middle Eastern countries and the United States for their efforts to mediate. Trump, who says he wants to be remembered as a peacemaker, has repeatedly said he wants to end the \"bloodbath\" of the Ukraine war which his administration casts as a proxy war between the United States and Russia. \"I will continue to work with both sides to make sure that it happens,\" Trump said in his Truth Social post on Sunday. \"The USA wants to focus, instead, on Rebuilding and Trade. A BIG week upcoming!\" Former U.S. President Joe Biden, Western European leaders and Ukraine cast the invasion as an imperial-style land grab and repeatedly vowed to defeat Russian forces. Putin casts the war as a watershed moment in Moscow's relations with the West, which he says humiliated Russia after the Soviet Union fell in 1991 by enlarging NATO and encroaching on what he considers Moscow's sphere of influence, including Ukraine.",

Burnes (2-1) gave up five singles, struck out five and walked two in his return to the mound. He missed his previous start because of shoulder inflammation that required a cortisone shot, which led to his first missed turn since 2021. Suarez homered off Dustin May (1-3) to give the D-backs a 2-0 lead in the sixth inning after Corbin Carroll tripled and scored on Ketel Marte's groundout in the third. Carroll leads the majors with five triples. Pavin Smith added three hits, including an RBI double in the eighth. Tim Tawa had a single, a walk and two stolen bases in his first start in left field for the D-backs, who are assured of no worse than a split in the four-game series that ends Sunday. Shohei Ohtani and Max Muncy singled and walked for the Dodgers, who were shut out for the third time this season. Freddie Freeman was 0-for-4 to end his 14-game hitting streak, during which he was 25-for-53 (.472). Ohtani led off the game with a single, but was erased on a Mookie Betts double play. The Dodgers had as many as two runners on base in only the third and fourth innings. Burnes got Betts to fly out after intentionally walking Ohtani to put runners on first and second in the third. He struck out Enrique Hernandez and Michael Conforto after Andy Pages singled and Max Muncy walked with one out in the fourth. Burnes threw 91 pitches and got 17 of his 21 outs on groundouts or strikeouts. He retired 11 of the final 13 he faced and threw first-pitch strikes to 10 of the last 11. Ryne Nelson got all six batters he faced to become the eighth Arizona pitcher to record a save this season. May gave up two runs and seven hits before leaving with two outs in the seventh -- his longest outing of the season. He struck out five and walked one. Ohtani threw a 34-pitch bullpen two hours before the game, but manager Dave Roberts said there is no timetable for his return to the mound. --Field Level Media",

    "content": "AMRITSAR, India/ MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan, May 11 (Reuters) - A fragile ceasefire was holding between India and Pakistan on Sunday, after hours ofovernight fightingbetween the nuclear-armed neighbours, as U.S. President Donald Trump said he will work to provide a solution regarding Kashmir. Thearch rivalswere involved inintense firingfor four days, the worst in nearly three decades, with missiles and drones being fired at each other's military installations and dozens of people killed. A ceasefire agreement was reached after diplomacy and pressure from the United States, but within hours, artillery fire was witnessed in IndianKashmir, the centre of much of the fighting. Blasts from air-defence systems boomed in cities near the border under blackout, similar to the previous two evenings, according to authorities, residents and Reuters witnesses. Late on Saturday, India said Pakistan had violated the understanding arrived to stop firing and that the Indian armed forces had been instructed to \"deal strongly\" with any repetition. In response, Pakistan said it was committed to the ceasefire and blamed India for the violations. By dawn, the fighting and explosions reported overnight had died down on both sides of the border, according to Reuters witnesses. Power was restored in most areas along India's border towns after a blackout the previous night. Trump praised leaders of both countries for agreeing to halt the aggression. \"While not even discussed, I am going to increase trade, substantially, with both of these great nations. Additionally, I will work with you both to see if... a solution can be arrived at concerning Kashmir,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social. In the border city of Amritsar, home to the Golden Temple revered by Sikhs, a siren sounded in the morning to resume normal activities brought a sense of relief and people were seen out on the roads. The fighting started on Wednesday, two weeks after 26 men were killed in anattacktargeting Hindus in Pahalgam in Indian Kashmir. \"Ever since the day terrorists attacked people in Pahalgam we have been shutting our shops very early and there was an uncertainty. I am happy that at least there will be no bloodshed on both sides,\" Satvir Singh Alhuwalia, 48, a shopkeeper in Amritsar told Reuters. Officials in Pakistan said there was some firing in Bhimber in Pakistani Kashmir overnight but nowhere else, and there were no casualties. The two countries, born out of British colonial rule in 1947, have gone to war three times - twice over the region of Kashmir. Hindu-majority India and Muslim Pakistan both rule part of Kashmir but claim it in full. India blames Pakistan for an insurgency in its part of Kashmir that began in 1989 and has killed tens of thousands. It also blames Pakistani Islamist militant groups for attacks elsewhere in India. Pakistan says it provides only moral, political and diplomatic support to Kashmiri separatists. The combined death toll in the recent skirmishes has reached nearly 70, officials have said. \"More than me, my family is happy because my children and wife have been calling me every hour to check on me. Thank God the ceasefire happened,\" Guruman Singh, a security guard in Amritsar told Reuters.",

Called up to replace injured Shota Imanaga (strained left hamstring), Horton (1-0) followed opener Brad Keller and allowed three runs on four hits. The 2022 first-round pick struck out five, walked none and threw 77 pitches. Horton had his parents, siblings and other family members in the stands after joining the team from Triple-A Iowa, and he displayed a fastball that averaged about 95 mph along with an effective sweeper. Horton entered the game after the Cubs took a 2-0 lead in the first inning off New York starter Tylor Megill (3-3) on RBI singles by Seiya Suzuki and Dansby Swanson. Suzuki also doubled and scored on an RBI single by Michael Busch in the third and Swanson homered in the fourth as the Cubs halted their first three-game losing streak of the season. Miguel Amaya added a crucial two-run single in the eighth as the Cubs went 4-for-8 with runners in scoring position. Brett Baty hit a three-run homer off Horton in the fourth and a two-run shot off Julian Merryweather in the eighth, but the Mets fell to 14-4 at home and wasted numerous opportunities. New York went 1-for-10 with runners in scoring position against Keller, Horton and four other pitchers. Horton started his outing with a strikeout of Brandon Nimmo and retired Francisco Lindor and Juan Soto with two runners on base for the final two outs of the third. He gave up three hits in the fourth, but maintained the lead by retiring Francisco Alvarez to end the frame. Drew Pomeranz followed Horton and pitched a scoreless sixth, then Daniel Palencia retired Soto and Pete Alonso in the seventh with a runner on second to protect the one-run lead. Merryweather allowed Baty's two-run drive in the eighth. Porter Hodge retired Lindor on a double play grounder and retired Soto to secure his second save.

Jankowski knocked the ball into left field off Milwaukee reliever Grant Anderson (1-2), scoring Kameron Misner, who had drawn a walk and stole second. Closer Pete Fairbanks (3-1) got out of a bases-loaded jam in his lone inning in the ninth to earn the win for the Rays, who claimed the series. The Brewers have lost three in a row. Milwaukee starting pitcher Tobias Myers held Tampa Bay to one hit and three baserunners (two walks) over the first three innings before the hosts broke through to take the lead in the fourth. After Jonathan Aranda led off with a single, Misner drew a one-out walk. Taylor Walls then lined a double into right field to drive in Aranda and tie it 1-1. Jankowski followed with a sacrifice fly to right-center field, scoring Misner for a 2-1 Rays advantage. With rain coming down in the top of the fifth inning, Joey Ortiz connected on a fastball, sending it into the right-field deck to tie the game at 2. It was his first home run since Sept. 20, 2024. Jackson Chourio gave the Brewers a 1-0 lead in the top of the third. With two out, Chourio launched a splitter 108 mph off the bat into the left-center field deck for his first home run since April 26. The game's start endured a half-hour delay because of inclement weather in Tampa. It was the first weather delay at home in franchise history for the Rays, who are temporarily utilizing the New York Yankees' spring training complex as their home field while the roof on their usual home, Tropicana Field, undergoes major repairs from hurricane damage. A 38-minute rain delay put the brakes on the contest in the bottom of the fifth. Tampa Bay starter Taj Bradley returned to the mound in the top of the sixth after the delay and showed no effects from the layoff, getting the Brewers out in order. --Field Level Media",

    "content": "May 11 - Anthony Edwards poured in a game-high 36 points, Julius Randle had 24 as part of a triple-double and the Minnesota Timberwolves wrestled back home-court advantage in their second-round playoff series against the Golden State Warriors with a 102-97 triumph Saturday night in San Francisco. Game 4 in the Western Conference best-of-seven series is scheduled for Monday night in San Francisco, with the sixth-seeded Timberwolves leading 2-1. Jimmy Butler III had a team-high 33 points for seventh-seeded Golden State, which played without star guard Stephen Curry, out with a strained left hamstring. The tightly contested game saw the Warriors clinging within 84-82 before two game-disqualifying fouls on defensive ace Draymond Green within 18 seconds inside the final five minutes. The Timberwolves took control from there, getting a key 3-pointer from Jaden McDaniels and a three-point play from Rudy Gobert, the latter creating a six-point cushion for the visitors with 2:05 to play. \"We're making some shots, for sure,\" Timberwolves coach Chris Finch said. \"We're getting stops. We were getting stops throughout the regular season. We're just winning the possession battle in clutch time now. We're just not -- we're not giving the ball back on cheap turnovers. We're not giving up as many or any second-chance opportunities.\" A 3-pointer by Edwards, his fifth of the game, all but clinched Minnesota's second consecutive win - both with Curry out of the Golden State lineup - with 1:19 to go. Edwards' 36 points were his second most this postseason, topped only by a 43-point explosion in Game 4 against the Los Angeles Lakers in the first round. He hit 13 of his 28 shots on Saturday. \"The team defense was really good,\" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. \"Held them to 102. That's a pretty good number. But Randle and Edwards really both got going in the second half and that was the key. We couldn't quite contain them, especially in the fourth, and that was the difference.\" Randle complemented his 24 points with 10 rebounds, a game-high 12 assists and three steals for the Timberwolves, who outshot the hosts 43.9 percent to 43.2 percent in a defensive struggle. \"He's playing with so much force and determination,\" Finch said of Randle. \"He's going out there early and aggressive, and he's exerting a ton of energy on the defensive end with his body and his rebounding. He's playing a complete game for us, no doubt.\" McDaniels added 15 points and Gobert had a game-high 13 rebounds for Minnesota, which went 2-1 on the road in its 4-1 first-round series win against the Lakers. Butler's 33 points on 12-for-26 shooting were his most since he had 35 for the Miami Heat in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals at Boston in 2023. He also found time for seven rebounds and a team-high seven assists. \"Man, Jimmy was incredible,\" Kerr said. \"He really controlled the game for us and put us in a position to win and we just couldn't close it out. But he was brilliant all night.\" Jonathan Kuminga, pressed into increased playing time as the Warriors looked to fill the void of Curry's regular scoring, backed Butler with a postseason career-high 30 points. He had totaled just 43 in Golden State's first nine playoff games. \"JK played one of the best games of his life,\" Kerr said. \"It was fantastic to see. You can see how necessary he is in this matchup, especially without Steph.\" Buddy Hield shot 4-for-8 on 3-pointers to account for a majority of his 14 points for the Warriors, while Brandin Podziemski collected a team-high eight rebounds on a night when he shot 1-for-10. -Field Level Media",

    "content": "May 11 - Gift Monday scored in the 83rd minute to break a tie as the Washington Spirit defeated the Chicago Stars FC 3-2 on Saturday afternoon at Bridgeview, Ill. The Spirit (5-3-0, 15 points), who snapped a two-match losing streak, also had a goal from Rosemonde Kouassi and benefited from a first-half own goal that marked the first goal of the match. Washington scored on both of its shots on goal. Julia Grosso and Sam Staab scored for Chicago (1-6-1, 4 points). Kouassi, whose goal marked her first in NWSL play, assisted on the go-ahead goal. Monday shielded a defender in front of the net and took a pass from Kouassi to deliver the goal from short range. Monday, who was a substitute, has scored in back-to-back matches and has three goals this season. Tara McKeown assisted on Kouassi's goal, making a precision pass as Kouassi cut through the box toward the net. Aubrey Kingsbury made two saves for the Spirit. Orlando Pride 1, North Carolina Courage 1 Prisca Chilufya scored in extra time as the Orlando Pride secured a draw with the North Carolina Courage at Cary, N.C. Chilufya, an NWSL rookie, secured her first career goal in the league. Her header off Angelina's corner kick went high into the air and off the fingers of Courage goalkeeper Casey Murphy in the 93rd minute. Feli Rauch scored in the 27th minute for the Courage (2-3-3, 9 points). The Pride (5-2-1, 16 points) held a 15-7 edge in shot attempts. Still, Orlando has gone back-to-back matches without a victory for the first time this season. Portland Thorns FC 1, San Diego Wave FC 1 Jayden Perry's penalty kick deep into extra time provided the visiting Thorns with the tying goal. San Diego's Kimmi Ascanio, a 17-year-old, scored in the sixth minute, but the Wave couldn't quite withstand a player-down situation for more than half of the match. San Diego (4-2-2, 14 points) lost defender Kennedy Wesley to a red card late in the first half. A foul on the Wave's Kristen McNabb in the penalty area set up Perry's opportunity. Ascanio headed in the ball off a pass from Perle Morroni. Ascanio has scored two goals in the past three matches. Portland (3-2-4, 13 points) finished with 21 shots compared to five for the Wave. --Field Level Media",

Jo Adell homered and the Angels scored in three of the first five innings on the way to snapping a two-game skid. The Orioles lost for the sixth time in their last seven games, with Ryan Mountcastle accounting for two of the team's six hits and Ramon Laureano providing a ninth-inning, pinch-hit home run. Kyle Gibson (0-2), making his third start of the season, took the loss, giving up five runs in four innings. Kochanowicz (2-5) worked 5 2/3 innings, allowing one run on four hits and four walks while striking out four. Brock Burke, the last of four relievers, closed out the victory despite surrendering Laureano's homer to open the ninth. Nolan Schanuel had two hits and a run for Los Angeles, which has won four of its last seven. The Angels put up two runs in the first inning, with Yoan Moncada's single and Taylor Ward's sacrifice fly providing the runs. Adell's fifth homer of the season came with two outs in the fourth. The Angels weren't done in the inning, with Matthew Lugo's triple -- his first major league hit and RBI -- making it 4-0. Luis Rengifo's groundout plated another run in the fifth. Mountcastle's two-out double in the sixth got the Orioles on the board. Baltimore avoided more trouble in the bottom of the inning when Cionel Perez escaped a bases-loaded jam. Laureano's fifth home run of the season came when he pinch hit for Ryan O'Hearn. The Angels prevailed despite stranding eight runners on base. They drew six walks.

    "title": "UK plans to end 'failed free market experiment' in immigration",
    "content": "LONDON, May 11 (Reuters) - The British government outlined plans on Sunday to end what it called the \"failed free market experiment\" in mass immigration by restricting skilled worker visas to graduate-level jobs and forcing businesses to increase training for local workers. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is under pressure to cut net migration after the success of Nigel Farage's right-wing, anti-immigration Reform UK party in local elections this month. Under the government's new plans, skilled visas will only be granted to people in graduate jobs, while visas for lower-skilled roles will only be issued in areas critical to the nation's industrial strategy, and in return businesses must increase training of British workers. The Labour government said the changes will be part of a policy document, known as a white paper, to be published on Monday setting out how ministers plan to reduce immigration. High levels of legal migration were one of the major drivers behind the vote to leave the European Union in 2016 with voters unhappy about the free movement of workers across the bloc. After Britain eventually left the EU in 2020, the then Conservative government reduced the threshold to allow workers in categories such as yoga teachers, dog walkers and DJs to be eligible for skilled worker visas. \"We inherited a failed immigration system where the previous government replaced free movement with a free market experiment,\" Yvette Cooper, the British interior minister, said in a statement. \"We are taking decisive action to restore control and order to the immigration system.\" While post-Brexit changes to visas saw a sharp drop in the number of European Union migrants to Britain, new work visa rules and people arriving from Ukraine and Hong Kong under special visa schemes led to a surge in immigration. Net migration, or the number of people coming to Britain minus the number leaving, rose to a record 906,000 people in the year to June 2023, up from the 184,000 people who arrived in the same period during 2019, when Britain was still in the EU.",

    "content": "May 11 - Reilly Smith scored his second goal of the game in the final second of regulation, giving the visiting Vegas Golden Knights a shocking 4-3 victory over the Edmonton Oilers on Saturday in Game 3 of their Western Conference second-round series. With overtime looming after the Oilers erased yet another third-period deficit with a late goal, Smith sent a puck to the front of the net in desperation and it banked into the cage off Leon Draisaitl's stick with 0.4 seconds remaining. \"That was one of the craziest things I've ever seen in a hockey game,\" Vegas defenseman Nicolas Hague said. \"I was sure it was in, but I saw the ref waive it off and it gave me some doubt,\" teammate William Karlsson said in a Sportsnet interview. \"But I saw the bench celebrate and that was a great feeling.\" The goal is the third-latest game-winning goal in Stanley Cup history. Nazem Kadri scored with one second remaining for the Colorado Avalanche in 2020, and Jussi Jokinen (Carolina Hurricanes) scored with 0.2 seconds in the game in 2009. \"It stings,\" Edmonton's Draisaitl said. \"It's an unfortunate way to lose but take stock and move on.\" Vegas, after losing the first two games at home, trails the best-of-seven set 2-1 and will try to pull even on Monday in Game 4 at Edmonton. Nicolas Roy and Karlsson also scored for Vegas, while goaltender Adin Hill made 17 saves. Corey Perry scored twice and Connor McDavid netted one goal and one assist for the Oilers, who saw their six-game winning streak snapped. Stuart Skinner, who started in goal after Calvin Pickard was sidelined due to an injury suffered in the previous game, stopped 20 shots. \"Devastating, but things happen. Good bounces, tough bounces happen for everybody, so just move forward,\" Skinner said. \"We're still up by one, so it's our job to show up again the next night, try our hardest and make this thing 3-1.\" It was yet another roller coaster of a game. Perry staked the Oilers to a 2-0 lead with a pair of goals. He opened the scoring at 7:19 by taking a pass in the high slot during a rush, patiently working toward the net and converting a wrist shot. His power-play goal four minutes later -- a nifty redirect of the point shot -- doubled the lead. However, the Golden Knights pulled even with a pair of goals 54 seconds apart before the first intermission. Roy, who received only a fine for his cross-checking major penalty last game, put his club on the board at 15:17 by chipping home a rebound. Smith tied the clash right after when he split the defenders and calmly lifted a backhand on the deke. Karlsson gave Vegas its first lead of the game at 17:05 of the second. During an odd-man rush, Karlson played give-and-go with Noah Hanifin and slipped home a short-side shot to make it a 3-2 game. \"That's not the way we play. We're normally a forechecking team and we didn't have it,\" Perry said. \"It's probably more deflating losing the way we did and not getting to overtime, but it's happened twice to us in these playoffs. Just use it as motivation.\" McDavid again tied the game at 3-3 with 3:02 remaining in regulation when his cross-crease feed banked off the skate of Vegas defenseman Brayden McNabb and into the net. Vegas captain Mark Stone left the game due to an upper-body injury suffered late in the first period. During one of his final shifts, Stone lost his footing as he tried to make a sharp turn while attempting to play the puck, and he fell. Perry inadvertently skated into him. It appeared either Perry's skate hit Stone's hand or his leg hit his arm. -Field Level Media",

    "content": "TOKYO, May 11 (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba reiterated on Sunday that he will aim for the elimination of all tariffs in trade negotiations with the United States. Speaking on a Fuji Television morning program, Ishiba said that \"discussions have gradually come together,\" and that Tokyo's relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump is \"surprisingly good.\" However, Ishiba said that Washington's agreement with London,announcedon Thursday, which lowers prohibitive duties on British car exports while keeping a baseline 10% tariff in place, was \"one model\" for trade deals, \"but we should aim for 0% tariffs.\" Saying that high auto import levies would make cars more expensive for U.S. consumers, Ishiba added, \"for the sake of the American economy as well, shouldn't those tariffs be lowered?\" Trump said on Friday that the U.S. willmaintaina baseline 10% tariff on imports even after trade deals are struck, adding there could be exemptions when countries offer significant trade terms. Currently, Japan faces a 25% levy on economically crucial auto exports to the United States, and a reciprocal 24% tariff on other Japanese goods. In terms of supporting the domestic economy, Ishiba said that the government needs to think carefully about a mooted reduction in consumption tax. \"If we suddenly lower the consumption tax, what happens to the country's finances?\" he said. \"We have to think if there aren't other ways that we can help those who are truly in need.\"",

Bo Bichette doubled and homered for the Blue Jays, who won their third consecutive game and snapped Seattle's streak of having won nine straight series. The Mariners' Rowdy Tellez went deep for the fourth time in five games this season against his former ballclub. Toronto reliever Mason Fluharty (3-0) got the victory and Jeff Hoffman worked the ninth for his ninth save. The Blue Jays rallied from a three-run deficit. They pulled ahead after George Springer led off the eighth with a walk off Carlos Vargas (1-2) and stole second. With one out, Barger, who was born in the Seattle suburb of Bellevue, Wash., grounded a single to right to plate Springer. Ernie Clement followed with a single and, with two outs, Myles Straw lined a two-run single to right to cap the scoring. Tellez's solo shot to left-center field with two outs in the second off Blue Jays starter Bowden Francis broke a scoreless tie. The Mariners extended their lead to 3-0 in the fourth. Julio Rodriguez grounded a leadoff single to center and Cal Raleigh drew a walk. Randy Arozarena doubled to left to score Rodriguez, then Raleigh came home on Leody Taveras' one-out sacrifice fly to right. The Blue Jays got on the board in the fifth as Clement drew a leadoff walk and, with two outs, Bichette hit a drive to right that just eluded a leaping Taveras at the wall. Toronto tied the score in the sixth. Springer led off with a single to right, ending the night for Mariners starter Logan Evans. Alejandro Kirk greeted reliever Gabe Speier with another single to right, sending Springer to third, before Barger grounded into a forceout to make it 3-3. Evans, a rookie making his third start in place of the injured Logan Gilbert (right flexor strain), went five-plus innings. The right-hander allowed three runs on five hits, with two walks and three strikeouts. Francis pitched 6 2/3 innings and gave up three runs on six hits, with one walk and five strikeouts. --Field Level Media",

Seager's second multi-homer game this season led a five-homer barrage by Texas. Joc Pederson hit a two-run shot, while Josh Smith and Evan Carter supplied solo homers. Adolis Garcia drove in two runs. Winning pitcher Jacob deGrom (3-1) lasted five-plus innings, giving up two runs and five hits while striking out a season-high 10. He fanned six consecutive batters in the first and second innings. Kerry Carpenter had a single, triple and homer for Detroit. Riley Greene added a solo homer for the Tigers, who saw their five-game winning streak snapped. Detroit starter Jack Flaherty (1-5) gave up five runs and four hits -- all homers -- in three innings. The four homers in one game were the most Flaherty's allowed in his career. The Rangers jumped on Flaherty early. Smith ripped a 2-2 slider over the right field wall for a leadoff home run. One out later, Seager flipped a 3-1 fastball over the right-center field wall. Detroit got one of those runs back in the bottom of the inning as Carpenter drilled a 1-2 fastball over the right-center field wall.

Langford walked again and scored on Seager's double to center. Following two more walks, Garcia hit a sacrifice fly.

    "content": "DUBAI, May 11 (Reuters) - Top Iranian and U.S. negotiators will resume talks on Sunday to address disputes over Tehran's nuclear programme, in a push for progress as Washington hardens its stance ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East visit. Though Tehran and Washington both have said they prefer diplomacy to resolve thedecades-longdispute, they remain deeply divided on several red lines that negotiators will have to circumvent to reach a new nuclear deal and avert future military action. Iranian Foreign Minister AbbasAraqchiand Trump'sMiddle East envoySteve Witkoff will hold the fourth round of talks in Muscat through Omani mediators, despite Washington taking a tough stance in public that Iranian officials said would not help the negotiations. Witkoff told Breitbart News on Thursday that Washington's red line is: \"No enrichment. That means dismantlement, no weaponization,” requiring the complete dismantling of Iran’snuclear facilities in Natanz, Fordow, and Isfahan. \"If they are not productive on Sunday, then they won't continue and we'll have to take a different route,” Witkoff said in the interview. Trump, who has threatenedmilitary actionagainst Iran if diplomacy fails, will travel to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates on May 13-16. Reacting to Witkoff's comments, Araqchi said on Saturday that Iran would notcompromise on its nuclear rights. \"Iran continues negotiations in good faith ... if the aim of these talks is to limit Iran’s nuclear rights, I state clearly that Iran will not back down from any of its rights,\" Araqchi said. Tehran is willing to negotiate some curbs on its nuclear work in return for the lifting of sanctions, according to Iranian officials, but ending its enrichment programme or surrendering its enriched uranium stockpile are among \"Iran's red lines that could not be compromised\" in the talks. A senior Iranian official close to the negotiating team said that U.S. demands for \"zero enrichment and dismantling Iran's nuclear sites would not help in progressing the negotiations\". \"What the U.S. says publicly differs from what is said in negotiations,\" the official said on condition of anonymity. He said matters would become clearer when talks take place on Sunday, which was initially planned for May 3 in Rome but were postponed due to what Oman described as \"logistical reasons\". Moreover, Iran has flatly ruled out negotiating itsballistic missile programmeand the clerical establishment demandswatertight guaranteesTrump would not again ditch a nuclear pact. Trump, who has restored a\"maximum pressure\" campaignon Tehran since February, exited Tehran's 2015 nuclear pact with six world powers in 2018 during his first term and reimposed crippling sanctions on Iran. Iran, which has long said its nuclear programme is peaceful, has breached the 2015 pact's nuclear curbs since 2019 including \"dramatically\" accelerating its enrichment of uranium to up to 60% purity, close to the roughly 90% level that is weapons-grade, according to the U.N. nuclear watchdog.",

    "content": "BUENOS AIRES, May 10 (Reuters) - Boca Juniors claimed a 4-2 penalty shootout win over Lanus on Saturday to reach the Argentine Apertura tournament quarter-finals, following a tense 0-0 draw under a cloud of fan dissatisfaction at the La Bombonera stadium. Boca goalkeeper Agustin Marchesin, who was pivotal in preserving the deadlock during the match, gave Boca an early advantage in the shootout by saving Alexis Canelo's opening kick. Lanus winger Dylan Aquino then blazed a shot over the bar while Boca held their nerve, converting their first three penalties with confidence. Substitute Milton Gimenez stepped up to convert the decisive spot-kick, sealing Boca's place in the next round where they will meet either Independiente or Independiente Rivadavia. Despite the win, the mood at La Bombonera was far from festive, as local fans voiced their frustration with a series of underwhelming performances, directing chants at both the players and club management. \"We definitely need to improve, but we achieved what we wanted to achieve, which was to get through the round. From here, we now have to work to improve,\" interim Boca coach Mariano Herron, who replaced sacked coach Fernando Gago last month, told reporters. \"We understand the fans' anger. We need to work to improve, but it's understandable that they weren't satisfied.\" On the pitch, the match itself was low on quality, with neither side managing to assert dominance or create significant scoring opportunities. Lanus had the best chance of the first half, with Ramiro Carrera's powerful long-range effort just before halftime, but Marchesin was on hand to make a crucial save. \"Fans can tell you how the match is going,\" Lanus captain Carlos Izquierdoz told ESPN. \"We attacked, we were well positioned, and the fact that their fans started to jeer means that we were doing things right. We were confident.\" The Boca goalkeeper, however, continued to thwart Lanus, denying Marcelino Moreno early in the second half and making a series of interventions to keep the scoreline level, setting the stage for Boca's successful penalty shootout. In the other Saturday last 16 fixtures, San Lorenzo secured a dramatic 2-1 win over Tigre, while Rosario Central made the most of their home advantage to knock Estudiantes out with a 2-0 victory. Platense pulled off a major upset by claiming a late 1-0 win at Racing Club. Title contenders River Plate host Barracas Central on Monday.",

Passenger vehicle sales totalled 1.78 million units last month and for the first four months of 2025 were up 8.2% from the same period a year earlier at 6.97 million units, data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA) showed on Sunday. Sales of electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids, known collectively as new energy vehicles, increased 33.9% year-on-year to make up 50.8% of total car sales last month. A government scheme that hands out larger subsides to trade-ins of old cars for NEVs than for gasoline vehicles had covered 2.71 million cars as of April 24, official data showed, cushioning the impact on Chinese consumer confidence as the increase in U.S. tariffs on Chinese exports disrupt trade between the world's two largest economies. Car exports slid 2.2% in April from a year earlier, extending an 8% decline in March, CPCA data showed.

    "content": "NEWARK, May 10 (Reuters) - Travelers flying in and out of New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport were increasingly edgy about a host of recent problems at the busy airport, but they were most alarmed about two separate equipment outages in the last two weeks that disrupted communications between air traffic controllers and pilots. The airport is one of the busiest in the United States, last year handling nearly 49 million passengers out of the New York metro area, the most populous in the country. Runway construction and air traffic control staffing shortages have caused cancellations and delays to spike in recent days. But the disruptions to communications between pilots and air traffic control left travelers shaken, with some questioning if flying out of the airport is safe. On Friday at around 4 a.m. EST (0800 GMT), a facility that guides air traffic in and out of the airport suffered a 90-second communicationsoutage, following an April 28 incident that also lasted about 90 seconds. “It's a little concerning that this is the second outage in under 30 days,” said Mikhail Liverpool, 37, from Somerset County, New Jersey, who said his flight to Georgia was delayed for four hours. “The fact that they didn't remediate the problem the first time is, you know, worrisome to say the least.” Newark was the preferred airport for Mark Nelson, a systems engineer at Siemens Healthineers, who travels for work and personal reasons. But after the two incidents, Nelson said he has decided to avoid it. \"If the FAA or someone tells you it is safe to fly from Newark, do not believe them,\" said Nelson. The airport was already considered a headache for travelers. Last year, JD Power ranked it the lowest in terms of overall customer satisfaction among mega airports in North America. The disruptions have become more acute. Since May 1, flight cancellations have surged to an average of 49 flights per day, up from 4 flights a day in early April, according to aviation analytics company Cirium. On-time departures dropped to 63%, well below industry norms of about 80%. Allison Miles, 34, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, said she now plans on avoiding Newark after her flight from Houston was delayed by more than 8 hours. \"I'll probably stay home for a lot this year, because until they can figure this out, I'm not going to get out there,\" she said. The Federal Aviation Administration plans to meet with major airlines on Wednesday, including United Airlines(UAL.O), opens new tab, the largest operator at Newark, about temporary cuts in flights at the airport. United hasculledabout 10% of its daily Newark flights and waived change fees and fare differences for customers affected by the disruptions. The FAA last yearrelocated controlof the Newark airspace to Philadelphia to address staffing and congested New York area traffic. United CEO Scott Kirby has blamed the airport's stretched infrastructure for the delays. He wants U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy to designate Newark as a slot-controlled airport, which would allow the FAA to limit the number of departing or arriving flights to prevent delays. DuffywantsCongress to allocate billions to upgrade the aging U.S. air traffic control system, but any overhaul wouldtake years. In the interim, some travelers said they'll shift airports. “Every other week I'm traveling, and the only issues I have is traveling here,” said John Clark, 50, from Greenville, South Carolina, and a regular United flyer. Moving forward, he is looking to fly out of LaGuardia Airport in Queens, even if it lengthens his commute to his New Jersey office. “I'll try LaGuardia again for a little while until that becomes a pain point.”",

    "title": "Knights' Mark Stone makes early exit from Game 3 vs. Oilers",
    "content": "May 11 - Vegas Golden Knights captain Mark Stone left the game late in the first period of Saturday night's Stanley Cup playoffs clash with the visiting Edmonton Oilers. Stone did not play the final six minutes of the opening frame and the forward did not return with the club after the first intermission. The club announced midway through the second period that Stone would miss the remainder of the game. In one of his final shifts, Stone lost his footing as he tried to make a sharp turn while attempting to play the puck, and he fell. Edmonton's Corey Perry inadvertently skated into him. It appears either Perry's skate hit Stone's hand or his leg hit his arm. Stone had collected four goals and four assists in the eight-plus games in this year's playoffs. Edmonton had a 2-0 lead going into Saturday's Game 3 of the best-of-seven Western Conference semifinal series. Vegas also was without forward Brandon Saad due to a lower-body injury suffered in Game 2. Stone, who turns 33 on Tuesday, was second on the team in the regular season with 67 points (19 goals, 48 assists) in 66 games. He has 231 career goals and 403 assists with a plus-141 rating in 706 regular-season games since 2012-13 season. He has been with Vegas since the 2018-19 season, including the Stanley Cup championship in 2023. --Field Level Media",

    "title": "Red Sox's Romy Gonzalez goes to IL, but Rafael Devers doesn't go to 1B",
    "content": "May 11 - The Boston Red Sox placed utility infielder Romy Gonzalez on the 10-day injured list Saturday with a left quad contusion, which further taxes the team's depth at first base. Gonzalez had been part of the platoon filling the shoes of Triston Casas, who ruptured the patellar tendon in his left knee on May 2 and underwent season-ending surgery. The 28-year-old Gonzalez subbed for Casas on May 2 and then made three starts at first in Casas' stead. During that span, Gonzalez went 5-for-12 with one double, two runs, two RBIs and two stolen bases. Though Gonzalez is out of the first-base mix until at least May 17, the Red Sox indicated they don't intend to shift Rafael Devers there. Devers drew widespread attention Thursday when he declared he wouldn't move to first after already shifting from third base to designated hitter during the preseason because of the arrival of Gold Glove third baseman Alex Bregman. \"After what happened to Casas,\" Devers told reporters via an interpreter, \"they came to me and I know that I am a player, but I can't play all the positions, either. I can't adapt like any other player to a different position. If I play first, they know that I won't play there (immediately).\" Devers' thoughts inspired Red Sox owner John Henry, along with general manager Craig Breslow, to visit the team in Kansas City for a meeting with the 28-year-old slugger. Red Sox manager Alex Cora has suggested conversations about a Devers move will continue. In the meantime, Boston replaced Gonzalez on the active roster with switch-hitting utility infielder Nick Sogard, who was recalled from Triple-A Worcester. Though the 27-year-old had just one inning of major-league experience at first base -- that coming in the 10th inning last Sept. 12 against the New York Yankees -- the Red Sox put him in the starting lineup Saturday night against Kansas City left-hander Cole Ragans. Sogard committed a throwing error in the seventh that did not lead to any runs. He also went 1-for-4 with a walk and one run scored as the Red Sox rolled to a 10-1 victory. He is expected to split time at first base with utility player Abraham Toro. --Field Level Media",

    "content": "May 11 - Elly De La Cruz drove in four runs during a 10-run first inning as the visiting Cincinnati Reds rode that breakout frame to a 13-9 interleague victory over the Houston Astros on Saturday. De La Cruz slugged a three-run home run and added a run-scoring groundout as the Reds pounced on Astros right-hander Lance McCullers Jr. (0-1), who was making his second start of the season. The 10-run frame marked the most first-inning runs by the Reds since they plated 14 against the Astros in an 18-2 home victory on Aug. 3, 1989. McCullers, whose season debut on Sunday was his first appearance since Game 3 of the 2022 World Series, walked TJ Friedl and hit Matt McLain with a pitch before De La Cruz smoked a line drive to left field for his sixth home run. McCullers issued one-out walks to Santiago Espinal and Spencer Steer before Tyler Stephenson laced an RBI single to extend the lead to 4-0. Will Benson chased McCullers with an RBI double. The Reds continued the onslaught against reliever Logan VanWey, with Friedl adding an RBI single and McLain a bases-loaded walk before De La Cruz plated Connor Joe with a grounder to short. Gavin Lux capped the uprising with a two-run single that scored Friedl and McLain as Cincinnati sent 14 hitters to the plate. McCullers allowed seven runs on three hits and three walks. Of his 36 pitches, 19 were balls. Despite being gifted an 11-run lead - McLain smacked his fifth homer, a two-run shot that scored Friedl in the third -- Reds starter Brady Singer could not escape the bottom of that frame. The Astros plated six runs in the third. Christian Walker followed an Isaac Paredes RBI double with a two-run triple. Victor Caratini (3-for-5) chased Singer with a two-run homer that sliced the deficit to 12-7. Singer allowed seven runs on nine hits and one walk with one strikeout over 2 1/3 innings. Houston closed to within 12-8 on a run-scoring single by Jeremy Pena (3-for-6, two RBIs) in the fifth, but Reds reliever Graham Ashcraft (3-3) stranded two in scoring position to mute the threat. Friedl recorded three hits and scored three runs and McLain scored three runs and had three RBIs. Astros second baseman Jose Altuve departed in the third with right hamstring tightness. Brendan Rodgers came on to pinch hit for Altuve and remained in the game. --Field Level Media",

It was the second four-hit game of the season for Devers and 15th of his career. Ceddanne Rafaela tripled, doubled and scored twice, Jarren Duran went 2-for-5 with an RBI and two runs and Alex Bregman had two hits and an RBI and scored a run for Boston, which pounded out 15 hits while evening the three-game series at one game apiece. Garrett Crochet (4-2) picked up the win, limiting Kansas City to one run on seven hits over seven innings. He walked one and struck out nine, including Bobby Witt Jr. with a 98 mph fastball with the bases loaded for the final out in the bottom of the seventh. Witt, who had two hits, doubled for the team's lone extra-base hit. Hunter Renfroe and Vinnie Pasquantino each added two hits for Kansas City, which lost for just the third time in its last 19 games. Cole Ragans (2-2) suffered the loss, allowing four runs on seven hits in five innings. He struck out eight and walked two. Boston took a 1-0 lead in the third when Duran singled with two outs and scored on a double to left-center by Devers, snapping a 23 2/3-inning scoreless inning streak by Kansas City starters. Kansas City tied it in the bottom of the third when Witt singled, stole second, went to third on a balk and scored on a two-out single by Mark Canha. The Red Sox took a 4-1 lead in the fifth when five consecutive batters reached base. Narvaez, who had three hits, started the rally with a walk and went to third on a double by Rafaela. Duran, Devers and Bregman followed with consecutive RBI singles. Boston broke the game open in the seventh with a three-run homer to left-center by Story to make it 7-1, and added three runs in the eighth on a two-run shot by Narvaez and an RBI single by Devers to drive in Rafaela, who had tripled. --Field Level Media",

    "content": "May 11 - Frederik Andersen recorded his first postseason shutout in five years as the Carolina Hurricanes beat the visiting Washington Capitals 4-0 on Saturday afternoon in Raleigh, N.C., to take Game 3 of their Eastern Conference semifinals series. Andersen stopped 21 shots for the Hurricanes, who took a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven series. Jack Roslovic scored a goal and assisted on another while Andrei Svechnikov got his sixth goal of the playoffs. Eric Robinson and Jackson Blake also scored. Logan Thompson made 24 saves for the Capitals, who could not take advantage of several early scoring opportunities. Much like the first two games in Washington, Game 3 was a tightly contested affair with few shot attempts. On Saturday, the Capitals enjoyed an early edge in higher-quality chances. Both teams owned 29 shot attempts midway through the second period, but the Capitals held a 10-3 edge in high-danger scoring chances. \"We've had some first periods like that,\" Roslovic said. \"Not recently, but throughout the year. I think it's just a realization of the way we play, and we got to clean it up a little bit. We always seem to get back to it and, if it weren't for Freddie, it could have been different.\" Andersen was definitely up to the task as he notched his fourth shutout in postseason play. He stopped Alex Ovechkin right in front of the crease with 5:52 left in the first period. Over the next 22 seconds, Andersen kept two Ovechkin tip-ins from getting past him. That included one on a faceoff where the Capitals captain skated through the circle and was by himself in the slot. Carolina, however, did score off a faceoff. While Washington's Nic Dowd won the draw in Carolina's attack zone, Svechnikov managed to beat John Carlson to the puck and his quick snapshot from the right circle made it 1-0 at 12:34 of the second period. \"It sucks, but it's the playoffs,\" Dowd said. \"It's going to happen. Things like that are going to happen. I know I'm not going to think about it after I answer these questions with you guys. It happens. Every single game of every single series has something that - like the game last night, the Florida game - a couple bounces, weird ones, they go in. It's the playoffs. You got to stick with it, a long series. You got to be consistent. Just keep going, keep pushing.\" Roslovic, inserted into the lineup due to Mark Jankowski's Game 1 injury, scored on a power play with 1:03 to go before the second intermission. Roslovic then assisted on Robinson's goal that came with 16:46 left in the game. Blake finished the scoring with 3:16 remaining. The second-period goals deflated the Capitals as they had only six shots on goal in the final period. They also mustered just three high-danger chances after the midway point of the second period. Andersen's last postseason shutout came as a member of the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 2020 qualifying round against the Columbus Blue Jackets. --Field Level Media",

    "content": "May 11 - Bryce Harper belted a two-run homer and Ranger Suarez threw seven shutout innings in his second start of the season as the visiting Philadelphia Phillies beat the Cleveland Guardians 7-1 on Saturday night. Harper had a season-high three hits, and his 411-foot shot to center off reliever Joey Cantillo ignited a six-run eighth for Philadelphia, which won for the 10th time in 13 games. Suarez (1-0) surrendered only three hits, all singles, during his 82-pitch outing. The left-hander struck out five and walked one after being on the injured list for most of the season with lower back stiffness. Kyle Schwarber extended his on-base streak to 45 games with a pair of singles, moving into a tie for the fourth-longest streak in Phillies history. Odubel Herrera reached in 45 straight games, a streak that began in the 2017 season and carried into 2018. Cleveland, which is 20-10 in a run that started April 8, scored its lone run in the ninth against Joe Ross. Carlos Santana had a sacrifice fly that brought home Gabriel Arias and marked his 1,100th career RBI. He is the 18th switch-hitter in major league history to reach that plateau. Guardians starter Tanner Bibee (3-3) was almost as effective as Suarez, giving up one run over seven innings. The right-hander allowed five hits while striking out three and walking none. Max Kepler's two-run double and RBI singles by Brandon Marsh and Edmundo Sosa accounted for the remainder of the runs in the eighth as Cantillo allowed the first seven batters he faced to reach base. He was charged with five runs on seven hits in 1 1/3 innings. The teams have split the first two games of their interleague series.

Marlins pitching limited the White Sox to four hits, including two from Lenyn Sosa. Jesus Tinoco worked a perfect ninth to pick up his third save. Chicago's Andrew Vaughn opened the scoring with a solo home run with two outs in the first, connecting against Marlins starter Edward Cabrera for his second homer in as many games. White Sox starter Shane Smith, a rookie right-hander, helped the lead stand up for much of the night. He scattered four hits over six scoreless innings while matching a career high with seven strikeouts. Smith didn't walk a batter while matching his April 8 outing at Cleveland with six scoreless frames. After surrendering a single to Xavier Edwards leading off the game, Smith allowed singles in the second and third innings but escaped further trouble. Javier Sanoja doubled to start the Miami sixth and advanced to third on a wild pitch before Smith worked out of the jam, retiring Wagaman on a flyout to right to end the threat. The Marlins broke through against the White Sox bullpen. Stowers tied the game with a seventh-inning solo shot against Steven Wilson before Miami rallied against Jordan Leasure and Brandon Eisert in the eighth. Eisert entered the game with two outs and walked the first batter he faced before Wagaman lined a two-run triple to left-center field. Michael A. Taylor attempted a diving catch but came up short as the ball rolled to the wall. Cabrera spaced one run and three hits in five innings with one walk and two strikeouts. Calvin Faucher (2-1) picked up the victory, yielding one hit with two strikeouts in a scoreless seventh. Leasure (0-3) allowed one run in 2/3 of an inning while striking out two. Sanoja had two hits for the Marlins. Connor Norby stole two bases. White Sox prospect Tim Elko was recalled from Triple-A Charlotte before the game and went 0-for-3 in his major league debut.

Rumeysa Ozturk, who was arrested after co-writing an opinion piece criticizing her school's response toIsrael's war in Gaza, told reporters after arriving at Logan International Airport in Boston that she was excited to get back to her studies and community after ajudge orderedher immediately released on Friday. \"This has been a very difficult time for me,\" she said at a press conference with her lawyers and local members of Congress. Ozturk thanked her supporters, including professors and students who have sent her letters, and urged the public not to forget about hundreds of other women still housed in the detention center. \"America is the greatest democracy in the world,\" she said. \"I have faith in the American system of justice.\" The 30-year-old PhD student wasarrested on March 25by masked plainclothes officers on a street in the Boston suburb of Somerville, Massachusetts, near her home, after the U.S. Department of State revoked her student visa. The sole basis authorities have provided for revoking her visa was an opinion piece she co-authored in Tufts' student newspaper criticizing the school's response to calls by students to divest from companies with ties to Israel and to \"acknowledge the Palestinian genocide.\" Her lawyers at the American Civil Liberties Union argued that her arrest and detention were unlawfully designed to punish her for speech protected by the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment and to chill the speech of others. U.S. Representative Ayanna Pressley, who with two other Democratic members of Congress from Massachusetts visited Ozturk while she was in custody, said she was held in \"squalid, inhumane conditions\" and denied proper medical care for worsening asthma attacks. \"Rumeysa's experience was not just an act of cruelty, it was a deliberate, coordinated attempt to intimidate, to instill fear, to send a chilling message to anyone who dares to speak out against injustice,\" Pressley said. After her arrest, Ozturk was briefly held in Vermont and then quickly flown to Louisiana by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She filed a lawsuit challenging her detention that is now assigned to U.S. District Judge William Sessions in Burlington, Vermont. He granted her bail on Friday after finding she had raised substantial claims that her rights were violated.",

    "content": "DHAKA, May 11 (Reuters) - Bangladesh’s interim government has banned all activities of the Awami League, the political party of deposed former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, under the country’s Anti-Terrorism Act, citing national security concerns. The decision, announced late Saturday, follows days of street protests led by the student-drivenNational Citizen Party, which emerged from last year’s uprising that toppled Hasina. Several Islamist and right-wing parties, including Jamaat-e-Islami and other opposition groups, joined the demonstrations, demanding the Awami League be designated a terrorist organisation. The ban would remain in place until the trial of the party and its leadership over deaths of hundreds of protesters at the International Crimes Tribunal is completed, the government said in a statement. The government also announced an amendment to the ICT Act, allowing the tribunal to prosecute not only individuals but also political parties and organisations. The change clears the way for the Awami League to be tried as a collective entity for alleged crimes committed during its time in power. The Awami League, which was founded in 1949, dismissed the decision as illegitimate, posting on its official Facebook page: “All decisions of the illegal government are illegal.” The country has seen rising tensions and protests in recent months, afterdeadly protestsforced Hasina to flee to India in August and an interim government led by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus took charge. Yunus pledged reforms and said the poll could bedelayed until 2026. The unrest began in July with student protests against public sector job quotas, but quickly morphed into one of the deadliest periods of political violence since Bangladesh’s independence in 1971. In October, the governmentbanned the Awami League’s student wing, Bangladesh Chhatra League, labeling it a “terrorist organisation” for its role in violent attacks on protesters.",

    "title": "Wellness companies eager to avoid WeightWatchers' fate embrace weight-loss drugs",
    "content": "NEW YORK, May 10 (Reuters) - Health and wellness companies are embracing weight-loss drugs and building offerings around them in an effort to avoid the fate of WeightWatchers, which declared bankruptcy this week, citing vastly increased use of the new blockbuster medicines. But some of WeightWatchers' closest rivals, newer telehealth companies, face a new challenge of their own as federal regulatorscrack downon the cheaper versions of Novo Nordisk's(NOVOb.CO), opens new tabWegovy and Eli Lilly's(LLY.N), opens new tabZepbound that have become a big part of the companies' sales. The telehealth companies' success may ultimately depend on partnering with the name brand drugmakers, one analyst said. WeightWatchersfiled for bankruptcyon Tuesday, as Americans shunned its weight management business in favor of the Novo and Lilly drugs and copies from pharmacies that can cut a person's weight by 15%-20%. The drugs, from a class of digestion-slowing medicines known as GLP-1 agonists, have eaten into demand at some big companies, including Walmart's(WMT.N), opens new tabfood business. WeightWatchers, when it filed for bankruptcy, said its weight management system stopped being attractive to customers given changing views about weight versus wellness, competition from telehealth companies fully embracing the weight-loss drugs, and even fitness influencers on TikTok. The company has an agreement with creditors to restructure its debt and quickly exit the court process. Adam McBride, CEO of Telehealth company Eden, said WeightWatchers, which tried to pivot to telehealth and sell weight-loss drugs, had an old school system that relied on points and in-person gatherings that customers didn't like. \"I don't think that they were listening to their members,” McBride said. Eden and rival Noom both operate weight-focused telehealth platforms with integrated lifestyle coaching - something WeightWatchers struggled with. The newer companies have been selling unbranded versions of the in-demand weight-loss medications as part of their offerings. Clinical subscriptions that provide access to clinicians and prescription drugs make up over half of Noom's revenue, said CEO Geoff Cook. At rival Hims and Hers(HIMS.N), opens new tab, compounded weight-loss drugs accounted for 20% of revenue last year, and even WeightWatchers relied partly on such revenue. Noom presents the drugs as a kind of superpower weight-loss tool, which the company said then drives customers to other parts of its platform. \"In the last month or two, people who are taking the meds are actually logging more meals,\" said Noom's CEO. \"They're weighing in more and they're engaging in the other aspects of the Noom program at a rate that's even better than the flagship program.\" Other health companies see room for products and services that take advantage of the popularity of new weight-loss drugs, which some analysts forecast will have annual sales of $150 billion in the next decade. Health retailer The Vitamin Shoppe has seen a spike in demand for supplements that could help with loss of appetite, decreasing muscle tone, and other GLP-1 side effects, said President Muriel Gonzalez. Sales of a set of supplements marketed to people taking such drugs jumped more than 20% from a year ago, a company spokesman said. Last year, The Vitamin Shoppe launched a telehealth service, Whole Health Rx, that connects consumers with medical providers who can prescribe weight-loss drugs and recommend supplements to give people protein, fiber and multi-vitamins while on them. Other companies have made similar moves. Supplement-seller GNC,looking to capitalizeon the trend, last year added a section in stores dedicated to GLP-1 users, selling protein powder and fiber. WeightWatchers itself is still trying to pivot. A spokesperson said in a statement that the GLP-1 drugs for weight loss are a growing and essential part of its business. It said its program works, citing an internal study in which its clinic patients taking GLP-1 drugs lost 21% of their weight and then transitioned to its behavioral program and lost another 2% after 13 weeks. But easy sales of cheaper versions of the drugs are ending, even as lawsuits remain. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is blocking sales of cheaper compounded versions of the drugs now that Wegovy and Zepbound and their related diabetes medicines -- Ozempic and Mounjaro -- areno longer in shortage. Selling cheaper versions of the drugs has been a huge profit driver for these companies, and the loss is an issue, said Morningstar healthcare analyst Karen Andersen. One path forward for wellness companies is to work with brand name drugmakers, Andersen said. \"Companies like Novo, they need partners that have access to patients,\" she said. But finding creative ways to partner with key competitors is no small task, she added. \"It will be a rocky path.\"",

    "title": "Braves triumph on wild pitch in 11th as Pirates squander multiple chances",
    "content": "May 11 - Matt Olson homered and later scored the eventual winning run in the top of the 11th on a wild pitch to propel the Atlanta Braves to a 3-2 victory over the host Pittsburgh Pirates on Saturday night. Olson, who hit his seventh home run of the season in the third, was the automatic runner at second in the 11th and moved to third on a groundout by Ozzie Albies. Olson was unable to score on Sean Murphy's ensuing groundout, but he came home when Pirates reliever Chase Shugart (1-3) fired a pitch low and inside that barely missed the batter, Eli White, on its way to the backstop. Scott Blewett (2-0), who pitched a scoreless 10th, worked a perfect 11th despite the automatic runner Alexander Canario reaching third on a sacrifice bunt by Jared Triolo. Blewett struck out Liover Peguero looking and retired Tommy Pham on a groundout to end the game. Peguero was hitting for the first time after replacing Oneil Cruz, who left the game after the 10th inning with lower back tightness. The Braves improved to 5-0 in extra-inning games this season while the Pirates fell to 2-3 in such games. Pittsburgh has lost 11 of its last 13. The Braves led 2-1 heading into the bottom of the eighth before Joey Bart, who led the Pirates with four hits and an RBI, singled with one out. Ji Hwan Bae pinch ran for Bart, stole second and reached third on a groundout by Ke'Bryan Hayes. Matt Gorski then reached on an infield single to third off reliever Daysbel Hernandez as Bae scored to tie the game. The Pirates went on to load the bases after Hernandez walked Adam Frazier intentionally and Alexander Canario unintentionally, but Triolo flew out to end the inning. Pittsburgh failed to capitalize on chances to win in each of the next three innings, too. Michael Harris II opened the scoring for Atlanta with an RBI double in the second. The Pirates' Don Kelly, managing his second game since being elevated to the job Thursday, was ejected in the top of the sixth after arguing with home-plate umpire Clint Vondrak from the dugout. Third base coach Mike Rabelo managed the remainder of the game. Pirates outfielder Bryan Reynolds was ejected in the bottom of the seventh after a strikeout. --Field Level Media",

    "content": "SEOUL, May 11 (Reuters) - South Korea's former prime minister and acting president Han Duck-soo ended a short, ill-fated attempt to win the conservative party's presidential nomination on Sunday after days of internecine disputes just days out from the election. Rival Kim Moon-soo was chosen as nominee for the People Power Party afterparty members votedon Saturday to retain him over Han, whose late entry into the race derailed the consensus over its candidate for the June 3 presidential vote. Han on Sunday said he \"humbly accepts everything\" and hopes Kim wins the snap election, which was triggered by the impeachment of the country’s former president. Kim formally registered as a PPP candidate on Sunday morning, and is now South Korea's conservative hopeful against frontrunner Lee Jae-myung of the opposition Democratic Party. Han and Kim struggled for unity in the past week and had held a series of failed talks to discuss how to unite their conservative campaigns to avoid splitting the vote. Lee has been a clear frontrunner to replace conservative former President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was removed from office in April for violating his duties when he declared a short-lived martial law in December. Kim, who was selected as the conservatives' candidate in a party convention a week ago, resisted pressure from the party to step aside in favour of the more popular Han, who had declined to participate in the nomination process while he was still serving as prime minister.",

    "title": "Wary investors hope US-China talks cool high-stakes trade war",
    "content": "May 10 (Reuters) - Investors are hopeful thatU.S.-China trade talkswill cool a trade war between the world's two largest economies and dispel some of the uncertainty clouding financial markets, though few expect a major breakthrough just yet. The highly anticipated meeting in Switzerland could mark one of the biggest developments since U.S. President Donald Trumplaunched sweeping tariffson April 2, which threw the global trade landscape into chaos and set off extreme market volatility. \"This is the mother of all negotiations,\" said Alejo Czerwonko, chief investment officer, Emerging Markets Americas, at UBS. \"There are hundreds of billions of dollars of trade on the line, a 145% tariff on Chinese exports that amounts to some sort of de facto embargo and grievances that extend well beyond trade.\" The U.S.-China trade talks in Geneva had adjourned for the day and wereset to continue on Sunday, a source familiar with the discussions told Reuters. U.S. President Donald Trump said late on Saturday that the two countries had negotiated \"atotal reset... in a friendly, but constructive, manner.\" He added that \"great progress\" was made, without elaborating. Recently, investors have expressed optimism that the worst-case trade scenarios would not come to pass, and pointed to signs of de-escalation between the U.S. and China as a reason behind a rebound in equities. But despite comments by Trump ahead of the talks suggesting a lower level of Chinese tariffs, and a trade deal announced on Thursdaybetween the U.S. and Britain, many market participants said they were not expecting major breakthroughs this weekend. Rather, they confined themselves to hoping that nothing goes wrong when the two sides come face-to-face for the first formal round of what may be protracted negotiations. \"We're still doubtful that direct U.S.-China negotiations will lead to a 'grand compromise',\" said Thierry Wizman, global FX and rates strategist at Macquarie, in a note to clients. Both the U.S. and China may want, or even need, to reach a deal, said Liqian Ren, director of Modern Alpha at WisdomTree Asset Management. At this early stage, however, there seems to be little incentive to do so rapidly, she added. \"Each still wants to see how the other side copes with negative headwinds,\" Ren said. \"Right now, the market is maybe a little bit too optimistic in terms of what China and the U.S. can achieve and how fast events will move.\" Trade tensions between the two nations escalated last month, when the U.S. boosted tariffs on all Chinese imports to a whopping 145%, and China then raised levies on U.S. imports to 125%. On Friday,comments by Trumpthat an 80% tariff on Chinese goods \"seems right\" - making his first suggestion of a specific alternative to the 145% levies - created some hope of progress toward resolving the dispute. The benchmark S&P 500 stock index(.SPX), opens new tabhas already erasedthe steep losses seen in the immediate aftermath of the tariffs announcement on April 2, although businesses continue to warn investors of their impact, and the uncertainty they create, in earnings-related comments. The S&P 500 remains down about 8% from its February all-time high and roughly 4% for the year. Amid the tariff chaos, weak consumer sentiment surveys andother \"soft data\"have raised concerns about U.S. growth, although most economic data has indicated resilience in the economy. Volatility, meanwhile, remains. The Cboe Volatility Index(.VIX), opens new tab, the options-based measure of investor anxiety, hovered around 22 late on Friday - well below its recent closing high of 52.33 in early April, but above its longer-term median of 17.6. One of the factors curbing that volatility so far has been the high cost of establishing short positions betting on future market declines, said WisdomTree's Ren. \"When a single (social media post) from the president can make the market move 10%, it becomes very costly\" to establish those positions, Ren said. Equities soared on April 9 after Trump paused many of the heftiest tariffs for 90 days. Still, markets were poised for more volatility ahead, said Matt Gertken, head of geopolitical strategy at BCA, a macroeconomic investment research firm. Gertken said the firm's best advice was to \"sell on strength.\" Any signs of progress in the initial discussions would be welcome, and allow China to devote more energy to its domestic economic problems, said Andrew Mattock, a portfolio manager at Matthews Asia. \"To talk about any other scenario, you end up with a lose-lose outcome,\" he warned. Despite the relatively fast agreement with Britain, Claudio Irigoyen, head of global economics research at BofA Securities, cautioned that other deals would be harder to hammer out, with China being the toughest. \"I can see trade deals coming with India, Japan and maybe South Korea, down the road,\" he said. \"China - this is the most complicated and will be the last one to come,\" in part because the geopolitical relationship is entangled with the trade ties. Investors are concerned that negative scenarios have not been factored into markets. \"If we come out of Geneva with people using incendiary language and strong disagreements, I don't think that's priced in,\" said Czerwonko of UBS. The market would probably be content with only modest signs of progress, several investors said. \"We don't need happy talk,\" said Gertken.",

    "title": "Lip-outs galore at Truist as green speeds catch field by surprise",
    "content": "May 11 - FLOURTOWN, Pa. - The PGA Tour is visiting the Philadelphia Cricket Club for the first time, and after plenty of low scores Thursday, the course has bitten back. Minimal wind and soft greens at the club's Wissahickon Course made for a low-scoring first round of the Truist Championship, when Keith Mitchell fired a 9-under 61 to take the early lead. The field played through rain Friday that made the track feel longer than its 7,119 yards. On Saturday, a combination of bigger gusts and faster greens presented a twist for the field at the $20 million signature event -- and short missed putts were the theme of the day. \"The greens today were a different speed than they were yesterday. They were a lot faster,\" said Mitchell, who now sits three shots behind leaders Shane Lowry and Sepp Straka. \"The winds and the dry air made them a lot faster. So a couple holes were speed adjustments on 3 and 4.\" The third and fourth holes were three-putt bogeys for Mitchell, who had a day to forget en route to a 1-over 71. He lipped out a 3-foot par save at the par-3 eighth before the ultimate meltdown at another par-3, the 14th. Mitchell landed his tee shot to 5 feet of the pin, rolled his birdie try right past the cup and still couldn't get it right on the 3-footer for par. There are 70 players still in the field following two withdrawals Saturday, and Mitchell ranked 70th in putts per green in regulation (2.07). But others struggled as well. Rory McIlroy had a 4 1/2-foot putt take a 90-degree left turn on the lip en route to a double bogey at No. 7. Lowry watched a 7-foot birdie try at No. 8 lip out hard. And Straka's only bogey of the day came on a lip-out at the 12th hole. \"It was very tough today in those winds, particularly tough to hole putts,\" Lowry said. \"When you get inside 10 feet, to be really precise on these greens was tough.\" Lowry agreed with playing partner Mitchell's assessment of the green speeds. \"They were a lot quicker today, especially towards the end. I felt like we had a few putts where you're hitting them at die pace, which was not the case the first few days,\" Lowry said. \"The first few days, I felt like they were quite slow.\" That isn't to say the players were griping about the sudden difficulty. The Philadelphia Cricket Club has drawn positive to rave reviews throughout the week, as players voice their approval of an old-school Northeast track the likes of which they do not play regularly on tour anymore. \"I played with Harry English today, and (Max) Homa yesterday,\" Tony Finau said. \"We were talking about it, within 100- to 150-mile radius of this place, I think there's some of the best golf in the world. I'd love to see the tour make a lot more stops here. This is definitely a good one.\" --Adam Zielonka, Field Level Media",

    "content": "May 11 - KANSAS CITY, Kan. - If Chris Buescher weren't tired of Kyle Larson after last year's record-close finish at Kansas Speedway, he certainly should be after Saturday's qualifying session at the 1.5-mile track. Running what he called \"a perfect-feeling lap,\" Larson -- the last driver to make a run during time trials -- knocked Buescher off the provisional pole for Sunday's Advent Health 400 (3 p.m. ET on FS1, MRN and SiriusXM NASCAR Radio). Larson scorched the intermediate speedway with a lap at 183.730 mph (29.391 seconds), beating Buescher (183.374 mph) for the top starting spot by 0.057 seconds. That was a much wider margin, relatively speaking, than the heartbreaking 0.001-second advantage Larson held over the Roush Fenway Keselowski driver at the end of last year's spring race at Kansas. The Busch Light Pole Award was Larson's first of the season, his first at Kansas and the 22nd of his career. The pole is the 14th at Kansas for Chevrolet and the seventh this season for the auto maker. \"The qualifying lap felt really good,\" Larson said. \"You're watching SMT (data), and you can see that drivers are starting to hold it easy wide open in (Turns) 1 and 2. In (Turns) 3 and 4, some guys were getting tight. \"Buescher was able to run a good 3 and 4. I kind of had a plan on the line I wanted to run and just try to match it with the throttle, and fortunately, everything went great. My balance felt really good, I felt like I hit my marks and came up to speed through 3 and 4 good, so it was a perfect-feeling lap.\" In last spring's race, Larson surged forward at the finish to edge Buescher by less than 4 inches. That Buescher was again the victim of the speed in the No. 5 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet was not lost on the pole winner. \"It's definitely ironic and really cool,\" Larson said. \"I think it adds to the story line of what happened last year and probably builds anticipation for the race (on Sunday). I won't be thinking about it, I guess, when we're rolling around under caution, but, yeah, it's ironic and funny and cool all at the same time.\" Christopher Bell (183.268 mph) was third-fastest in time trials, falling two positions short of his fourth straight Kansas Speedway pole. Tyler Reddick qualified fourth at 183.150 mph, followed by last Sunday's Texas winner Joey Logano at 182.871 mph. Ty Gibbs, William Byron, Daniel Suarez, Chase Elliott and Ryan Blaney will start sixth through 10th, respectively. Kyle Busch and Josh Berry both hit the outside wall during their qualifying laps and will start 35th and 38th in Sunday's race. --By Reid Spencer, NASCAR Wire Service. Special to Field Level Media.",

    "content": "May 11 - Jayson Tatum finished with 22 points, nine rebounds and seven assists and the Boston Celtics pulled away for a 115-93 win over the host New York Knicks on Saturday afternoon in Game 3 of their Eastern Conference semifinals series. Payton Pritchard scored a team-high 23 points off the bench for Boston, which cut the Knicks' lead to 2-1 in the best-of-seven series. Jaylen Brown added 19 points and Derrick White had 17. Jalen Brunson scored 27 points on 9-for-21 shooting to lead the Knicks. Karl-Anthony Towns finished with 21 points and 15 rebounds. After struggling to score in the first two games of the series, the Celtics found their rhythm on offense. Boston shot 48.2 percent (40 of 83) overall and 50 percent (20 of 40) from 3-point range, and New York shot 40 percent (32 of 80) from the field and 20 percent (5 of 25) from beyond the arc. \"They got some clean looks early, and they see it go in, that gives them confidence. Then it's hard to shut them off,\" said Knicks coach Tom Thibodeau. \"We have to have greater awareness. We can't allow missed shots to take away from (our) defensive tenacity. We've got to bounce back.\" Tatum made a basket to put Boston on top 112-89 with 2:40 remaining. He assisted on a 3-pointer by Al Horford on the next possession, and Celtics coach Joe Mazzulla rested his starters for the remainder of the game with the score out of reach. \"This is the fun part. You don't get into the journey for it to be easy,\" said Mazzulla. \"It's been dark, but in a good way. You've just got to tap into your darkness, and that's it.\" The Celtics led 96-70 at the end of the third quarter. Boston led by as many as 31 points after Pritchard made a basket with 1:42 to go in the quarter, and the Knicks trimmed slightly into the deficit by scoring the final five points of the quarter on an alley-oop dunk by Mitchell Robinson, a floating jump shot by Brunson and a free throw by Robinson. \"I don't think we came with the mindset of being satisfied, but I think it was just subconsciously satisfied being up 2-0,\" said Brunson. \"Just not the way we need to approach the game.\" Boston sprinted to a 36-20 lead at the end of the first quarter. Pritchard drove the ball across half court and hit a baseline jumper as time expired to put the Celtics on top by 16. By halftime, the Celtics increased their lead to 71-46. Brown buried a 3-pointer to put Boston at the 70-point mark with 30.5 seconds left in the half, and he made one of two free throws in the closing seconds to give the Celtics a 25-point advantage. --Field Level Media",

    "content": "GENEVA/WASHINGTON, May 10 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump hailed talks with China in Switzerland on Saturday, saying the two sides had negotiated \"a total reset ... in a friendly, but constructive, manner.\" \"A very good meeting today with China, in Switzerland. Many things discussed, much agreed to,\" Trump posted on his Truth Social platform. Trump added: \"We want to see, for the good of both China and the U.S., an opening up of China to American business. GREAT PROGRESS MADE!!!\" He did not elaborate on the progress. Earlier, top U.S. and Chinese officials wrapped up the first day of talks in Geneva aimed at defusing atrade warthat threatens to hammer the global economy and planned to resume negotiations on Sunday, a source close to the discussions said. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng met for about eight hours with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in their first face-to-face meeting since the world's two largest economies heapedtariffswell above 100% on each other's goods. Neither side made any statements afterwards about the substance of the discussions nor signaled any specific progress towards reducing crushing tariffs as meetings at the residence of Switzerland's ambassador to the U.N. concluded at about 8 p.m. local time (1800 GMT). Bessent, Greer and He were meeting in Geneva after weeks of growing tensions prompted by Trump'stariffblitz starting in February and retaliation from Beijing that has brought nearly $600 billion in annual bilateral trade to a virtual standstill. The trade dispute, combined with Trump's decision last month to impose duties on dozens of other countries, has disrupted supply chains, unsettled financial markets and stoked fears of a sharp global downturn. The location of the talks in the Swiss diplomatic hub was never made public. However, witnesses saw both delegations returning after a lunch break to the gated U.N. ambassador's villa, which has its own private park overlooking Lake Geneva in the leafy suburb of Cologny. Earlier, U.S. officials including Bessent and Greer smiled as they left their hotel on the way to the talks, wearing red ties and American flags on their lapels. Bessent declined to speak to reporters. At the same time, Mercedes vans with tinted windows were seen leaving a hotel where the Chinese delegation was staying on the lakeside as runners preparing for a weekend marathon warmed up in the sunshine. Washington is seeking to reduce its $295 billion goods trade deficit with Beijing and persuade China to renounce what the United States says is a mercantilist economic model and contribute more to global consumption, a shift that would require politically sensitive domestic reforms. Beijing has pushed back against what it sees as external interference. It wants Washington to lower tariffs, clarify what it wants China to buy more of, and treat it as an equal on the world stage. China's official Xinhua News Agency said in a commentary on Saturday that the United States' \"reckless abuse of tariffs\" had destabilized the global economic order, but added that the negotiations represented \"a positive and necessary step to resolve disagreements and avert further escalation.\" \"Whether the road ahead involves negotiation or confrontation, one thing is clear: China's determination to safeguard its development interests is unshakable, and its stance on maintaining the global economic and trade order remains unwavering,\" Xinhua said. With distrust running high, both sides have been keen not to appear weak, and economic analysts havelow expectationsof a breakthrough. Trump said onFridaythat an 80% tariff on Chinese goods \"seems right\", suggesting for the first time a specific alternative to the 145% levies he has imposed on Chinese imports. He hassuggestedthe discussions were initiated by China. Beijing said the U.S. requested the discussions and that China's policy of opposing U.S. tariffs had not changed. China could be looking for the same 90-day waiver on tariffs that Washington has given other countries as negotiations take place, while any kind of tariff reduction and follow-up talks would be seen as positive by investors. Swiss Economy Minister Guy Parmelin met both parties in Geneva on Friday and said the fact that the talks were taking place was already a success. \"If a road map can emerge and they decide to continue discussions, that will lower the tensions,\" he told reporters on Friday, saying talks could continue into Sunday or even Monday. Switzerland helped to broker the meeting during recent visits by Swiss politicians to China and the United States. China's He is also provisionally scheduled to meet the director-general of the World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, during his stay, a spokesperson for the Geneva-based watchdog said. She has welcomed the talks \"as a positive and constructive step towards de-escalation\", calling for sustained dialogue between the two top economies. Since taking office in January, Trump has increased tariffs on Chinese imports to 145%, citing unfair trade practices and accusing Beijing of failing to curb the export of chemicals used to produce fentanyl, a lethal synthetic opioid. China retaliated with 125% retaliatory tariffs, and said it would not bow to \"imperialists\" and bullies.",

Pallante (3-2) allowed two runs on five hits, seven strikeouts and no walks for the Cardinals, who won their seventh consecutive game. St. Louis scored all of its runs in the second inning off Washington starter Trevor Williams (2-4). Helsley retired the first two batters in the ninth but surrendered a single to Jose Tena then walked the next two batters. He secured his seventh save by getting CJ Abrams to fly out. Williams allowed four runs on seven hits in six innings -- his longest start of the season. He struck out four and walked one. The Nationals' runs came in the eighth on Dylan Crews' two-run homer, one of only two extra-base hits for the team. They matched the Cardinals with seven hits overall but lost their fourth straight game. After a scoreless first, Williams plunked Willson Contreras with a pitch and walked Alec Burleson with one out. Pedro Pages' two-out single put St. Louis on the board. Victor Scott II then slashed an RBI single and Nootbaar drove in two with his ninth double of the season, giving the Cardinals a 4-0 lead. Washington threatened in the fifth with Keibert Ruiz's leadoff single and Jacob Young's bunt hit with two outs, but Pallante escaped further danger by striking out Crews. Cole Henry threw a perfect seventh in his 1 1/3 innings in relief of Williams, and Zach Brzykcy got the last two outs of the eighth. Tena laced a single off Pallante to begin the bottom of the eighth, and with one out, Crews hit his fifth homer of the season, which halved the Nationals' deficit and chased Pallante. JoJo Romero relieved Pallante and immediately allowed Abrams' double, but Romero retired Alex Call, walked James Wood and escaped trouble by getting Nathaniel Lowe to ground out. --Field Level Media",

    "content": "KYIV, May 10 (Reuters) - Major European powers threw their weight behind an unconditional 30-day Ukraine ceasefire on Saturday, with the backing of U.S. PresidentDonald Trump, and threatened PresidentVladimir Putinwith \"massive\" new sanctions if he did not accept within days. The leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Poland and Ukraine set the start of the ceasefire for May 12 at a meeting in Kyiv, during which they held a phone call with Trump. \"So all of us here together with the U.S. are calling Putin out. If he is serious about peace, then he has a chance to show it,\" British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told a press conference. \"No more ifs and buts, no more conditions and delays.\" Soon after the European leaders' announcement, the Kremlin appeared to pour scorn on it. \"We hear many contradictory statements from Europe. They are generally confrontational in nature rather than aimed at trying to revive our relations. Nothing more,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by Russian news agency Interfax. Peskov was later quoted by the state TASS news agency as saying that Russia would consider the ceasefire proposal, while Moscow has its own position. Western sanctions against Russia have been toughened repeatedly since itsfull-scale invasionin 2022, without ending the war. But following through on the threat would be a sign of growing Western unity after months of unpredictability in U.S. policy since Trump's return to the White House in January. After engaging directly with Russian officials,clashing publiclywith Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and briefly cutting vital military aid to Kyiv, Washington has patched up ties with Ukraine and signed an agreement giving the U.S. preferential access to newUkrainian mineralsdeals. Trump, who did not immediately comment publicly on the European leaders' remarks, has also signalled frustration with what Washington views as Putin's foot-dragging over a ceasefire. \"In the event that the ceasefire is violated, massive sanctions will be prepared, in coordination between the Europeans and the United States,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said. By imposing new sanctions, the White House would be aligning itself more closely with Western Europe, which has been rattled by a trade war in which Trump has imposed tariffs on them and other countries and has suggested he might not come to the defence of NATO allies that underspend on their defence. Zelenskiy said he and the visiting leaders had agreed the unconditional ceasefire must start on Monday and cover air, sea and land. If Russia refused, it would face new sanctions, including the strengthening of punitive measures targeting its energy and banking sectors, he said. The leaders later issued a joint statement summing up the contents of the proposed 30-day ceasefire and saying its main purpose was \"to make room for diplomacy\". They welcomed support for the proposal from both Europe and the United States and said that if Russia sought to apply conditions, \"this can only be considered as an effort to prolong the war and undermine diplomacy\". Peskov had been quoted as saying on Friday that Russiasupported the implementationof a 30-day ceasefire, but only with due consideration of \"nuances\". In remarks to U.S. broadcaster ABC broadcast earlier on Saturday, Peskov had suggested Western military assistance for Ukraine must stop for a temporary ceasefire to take effect. \"Otherwise it will be an advantage for Ukraine,\" he said. Macron said that if the ceasefire went ahead, it would be monitored mainly by the U.S. and European countries would contribute. Dmitry Medvedev, a former Russian president who is now a senior security official, derided the idea of giving Russia an option between being sanctioned or giving Ukrainian forces an opportunity to rebuild. \"Shove these peace plans up your pangender arses!\" he wrote on X. The European leaders said the terms of a peace deal would be negotiated during the 30-day pause in fighting. \"We have no illusions that the ceasefire will be breached,\" Zelenskiy said. On the eve of the summit, the U.S. embassy in Kyiv warned of a \"potentially significant\" air attack in the coming days. When the European leaders arrived in Kyiv by train on Saturday, a screen on the platform announced the arrival of the \"Bravery Express\". Zelenskiy accompanied them as they paid their respects at a Kyiv memorial honouring Ukrainian soldiers killed in the war. The visit falls on the final day of aMay 8-10 ceasefiredeclared by Putin that Ukraine did not accept, denouncing it as a sham. Both sides have accused each other of violating it. Reuters journalists at a field hospital near the front line in Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia region saw soldiers being brought in with combat injuries sustained since the Russian ceasefire began. \"There hasn’t been any ceasefire, shelling has continued just as before, drones are flying just like before, the same with explosives being dropped. Nothing has changed at all,\" said a wounded soldier who gave his name as Stanislav.",

    "content": "May 10 (Reuters) - Atletico Madrid coach Diego Simeone could not help but applaud the performance of striker Alexander Sorloth after the Norwegian scored all four goals in their 4-0 win against Real Sociedad in LaLiga on Saturday. Sorlothcompleted the fastest hat-trick in LaLiga historyin the opening 11 minutes before adding a fourth goal to seal the rout on the half-hour. \"I was very happy with the team's first half in general. Alex, of course, is a whole different matter,\" Simeone told a press conference. \"He had a fantastic night, especially those first 45 minutes, where he decisively finished every ball that came his way. That allowed us to take control of the game and take it to a place we never imagined possible before the game started.\" Despite becoming Atletico's leading scorer in the league this season with 17 goals, Sorloth has started more games from the bench (19) than featured in team's starting line-ups (13). \"If we go by the numbers, he's scored more goals coming on in the second half - except for today, obviously,\" Simeone said. The Argentine coach was then quick to outline the forward's other strengths. \"What I like about him is that he's important in every moment and context of the game you can imagine,\" Simeone continued. \"If we need to attack, he gives us a strong offensive weight in the area. If we counterattack, he has good passing for that. And if we're closed down and have to defend, his physicality gets us out of uncomfortable situations. \"He's playing the game the team needs and is making the most of his football and his goalscoring.\" Sorloth, who joined Atletico from Villarreal last August, gave credit to his teammates for contributing to his clinical performance. \"The balls were falling at my feet, my teammates were giving me really good passes,\" he said. \"I'm very happy... I hope to be in LaLiga for many more years and have more games like this. I struggled to get the season off to a good start. In October and November, I started to improve. Now my teammates know me better. \"It was the same situation as last season when I scoredfour goals against Real Madridand had a shot hit the post. Today was like a flashback.\" Sorloth spent two seasons on loan at Sociedad from Red Bull Leipzig between 2021-2023.",

    "content": "May 10 - The Dallas Stars already have wrested away home-ice advantage from the Winnipeg Jets in their Western Conference semifinals series. Now the Stars have the opportunity to assume control of the series when they play host to the Jets in Game 3 on Sunday afternoon. The best-of-seven Stanley Cup playoff series is even after Dallas won the opener 3-2 and the Jets responded with a 4-0 victory Friday in Manitoba. With three of the next four games being played in the heart of Texas, this is a golden chance for the Stars to take control against the regular-season champions. \"We feel good. We're a resilient group and we have a lot of confidence in our game,\" Stars forward Wyatt Johnston told the team website. \"At this point of the playoffs, we have a pretty good idea of what we need to do each night to win, so it's just a matter of putting our best game out there for Game 3.\" Dallas won three of four home games during its opening-round series victory over the Colorado Avalanche, which went a full seven games. That success gives the club a boost of confidence while returning home. Coming off a shutout loss provides the Stars extra motivation. \"Obviously, when you get shut out, it doesn't feel good,\" said Stars forward Matt Duchene. \"We're too good of a team to get shut out. He (Jets goaltender Connor Hellebuyck) made some great saves, he's going to have games like that - he might be MVP of the league this year - but we have to have a short memory.\" Speaking of confidence, the Jets received a boost with their Game 2 victory that was led by Nikolaj Ehlers scoring twice in a three-point outing and included a 21-save performance by Hellebuyck. \"We're playing our game, and we know what it looks like and we know what it feels like,\" Hellebuyck said. \"That being said, we've got to wipe it and go play a hard road game. It's never easy on the road, especially at playoff time.\" Winnipeg lost all three road games in its opening-round series over the St. Louis Blues. Not only is Sunday an opportunity for the Jets to show they can win on the road, but it is also a chance for Hellebuyck to be the dominant goaltender he can be away from his home arena. Hellebuyck was pulled in all three of those defeats in St. Louis. He needed Friday's shutout as much for his psyche as the team needed to win. \"There were stretches in the first round where I really liked my game. Just wasn't in the results,\" Hellebuyck said. \"I like where we're at. The team in front of me is playing phenomenal, so we're going to have fun. Just continue to have fun.\" The confidence from the goaltender was palpable in Friday's victory. \"For 51 minutes of that hockey game, we were really good and there was a nine-minute span where puck management wasn't great,\" Jets coach Scott Arniel said. \"... Dallas, you just saw why they're No. 2 in the league on their transition and their ability to attack. That's something that's kind of self-inflicted but 'Helly' made sure that we shut the door.\" --Field Level Media",

The company informed employees of an immediate work stoppage in the letter dated May 8. \"Following directives from the new administration in place in South Kivu Province, Twangiza Mining is obliged to suspend its activities,\" the letter signed by General Director Chao Xianfeng said, adding that equipment and vehicles were being placed on standby mode. The decision highlights tensions over resource control in Congo's mineral-rich eastern regions, where M23 rebel advances have placed strategic mining assets under new administration, creating uncertainty for international operators and commodity markets. The Rwanda-backed rebels seized control of Congo's two mineral-rich eastern provinces earlier this year, and aresolidifying theircontrol over the captured territories.

Leo waved from the passenger side of a Volkswagen vehicle as he arrived at Rome's St. Mary Major Basilica. Entering the church to a few shouts of \"Viva il papa\" (Long live the pope), Leo walked slowly to Francis' tomb, laying a white flower on it. He then knelt in prayer for a few moments. Leo made the trip to St. Mary Major after travelling to the small town of Genazzano, where he had earlier visited a shrine dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Leo, the former U.S. Cardinal Robert Prevost,was elected pope on May 8. He is a member of the Augustinian religious order, which runs the Shrine of Our Lady of Good Counsel in Genazzano. Leo shook hands and offered blessings to a few people in the crowd before entering the shrine. At the end of the visit there, the pope told those in the shrine that he wanted to come to pray for guidance in the first days of his papacy, according to a Vatican statement. The late Pope Francis, who died on April 21, made surprise visits to Catholic sites near Rome quite frequently. Heasked to be buriedat St. Mary Major in a simple tomb, decorated only with an inscription of the word \"Franciscus\", his name in Latin. Francis had a special devotion to the basilica, another Marian shrine. In the first days after his burial,more than 30,000 peoplepacked the church to visit his final resting place.",

    "content": "May 10 - Nikola Jokic struggled to make shots and Denver lost the offensive rebounding battle 18-5, yet the Nuggets won Game 3 over Oklahoma City and have an opportunity to take a commanding lead in their Western Conference semifinal series on Sunday afternoon. The Nuggets' 113-104 overtime win Friday night gave them a 2-1 lead in the series, and they will host Game 4 in Denver. The Thunder experienced this situation in the playoffs last year -- the No. 1 seed down and on the road in the second round -- and fell to Dallas in six games. There will be a sense of desperation Sunday that should be similar to Oklahoma City's Game 2 performance, when it won by 43 points. The Thunder are a plus-32 in this series yet have lost two of the first three games, and the losses have been similar -- a lack of execution in the fourth quarter that allowed an outmanned Denver team to escape while relying on its championship experience. Oklahoma City star and potential MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander scored only three points in the fourth quarter when he shot 1-for-8 from the field, and he didn't attempt a field goal in overtime. \"The game gets slower, execution matters more. In those moments when the game slows down, it usually comes down to your best players making shots and making plays,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \"I didn't do a good enough job of that.\" Despite the taunts he heard from Nuggets fans, he remains unwavering heading into Game 4. \"Nothing's written,\" he said. \"The series is not over.\" His teammates haven't lost confidence, either. \"We obviously haven't won a championship like they have. But we've had close games against great teams on the road, and we've won,\" Alex Caruso said. The Nuggets have done that in two of the first three games even though the Thunder have frustrated Jokic. He fouled out of Game 2, missed all 10 of his 3-point attempts Friday night and was 8-for-25 from the field. He did make both his shot attempts in the overtime period but missed a potential game-winner at the end of the fourth quarter. Oklahoma City has mixed up its defenses on the three-time MVP, bottling him up in the paint and forcing him to the perimeter. Jokic has dealt with nearly every situation in his career, but he has not solved the Thunder's defense. \"I don't know what they are doing,\" he said about the Thunder's defense. \"Because if I knew, probably I'm not going to have those kinds of mistakes. So I need to figure out what they're doing.\" It took Aaron Gordon's tying 3-pointer in the final minute of regulation and the bounce-back game from Michael Porter Jr. -- who went 5-for-6 from deep on his way to 21 points -- to rescue Denver. Porter's play has been inconsistent due, in large part, to a sprained left shoulder that he has wrapped during games. He said he took an injection of lidocaine in his ailing joint, which normally needs up to six weeks to heal. He said missing time wasn't an option. \"I knew I wasn't doing that,\" Porter said. --Field Level Media",

Second half goals from Takumi Minamino and Denis Zakaria sealed Monaco a place in Europe's top club competition, where they will join Ligue 1 champions Paris St Germain and Marseille. Marseille led at Le Havre through Amine Gouiri’s 53rd minute score but saw Issa Soumare equalise after a 15-minute interruption in the second half when the referee took the teams into the changing rooms in response to trouble in the stands. But Mason Greenwood struck his 19th league goal of the season in the 86th minute to put them back ahead and Gouiri added the third deep in stoppage time to leave Le Havre facing the possibility of relegation next Saturday when all nine fixtures will kick off simultaneously. Marseille moved up to 62 points while Monaco are on 61. The other French places in European club competitions will be decided on the final day of the season next weekend. Fourth place in Ligue 1, which guarantees a place in the Champions League preliminary rounds next season, is still up for grabs with Nice, Lille and Strasbourg all on 57 points after they all lost on the road. PSG rested almost all of the team that earlier this week secured a place in the Champions League final but still turned out comfortable 4-1 winners at Montpellier. PSG had already retained the title last month and with both the Coupe de France final and the Champions League decider against Inter Milan later this month, coach Luis Enrique elected to field a second-string side, keeping only two starters from Wednesday’s semi-final success over Arsenal. They still proved too strong, however, for already-relegated Montpellier with Goncalo Ramos netting three, one from the penalty spot, after teenager Senny Mayulu had the opened the scoring one minute before halftime. PSG advanced to 81 points. Stade Rennais beat Nice 2-0 while Lille were edged by the same score at Brest. Strasbourg lost 2-1 at Angers, who moved to safety with the win. St Etienne kept alive their hopes of avoiding the drop with a 2-0 away win over cup finalist Stade Reims.",

    "content": "May 10 - The New York Giants have an eclectic mix of players competing for their starting quarterback job, though naturally fans have a great deal of curiosity about the most inexperienced of the bunch, rookie Jaxson Dart. On Saturday following the first day of Giants rookie minicamp, head coach Brian Daboll offered his positive first impressions of the Giants' No. 24 overall selection in last month's NFL Draft. Speaking about the signal-caller's poise on Day 1, Daboll said, \"There's nobody rushing him. He did what he was supposed to do. He was prepared. He put a lot of time and effort into it. I got a lot of appreciation for how he's gone about -- in a short amount of time -- his business. \"What we've asked him to do and how he's gone about his business as a young pro at that position is important.\" The former Ole Miss star has the advantage of significant collegiate experience, where he played in 45 games over four seasons, including 13 in each of the last three years in Oxford, Miss. His final year was his most productive. He set career highs in completion percentage (69.3 percent), yards (4,279) and touchdowns (29) while chipping in 495 yards and three touchdowns on the ground. Dart now has to compete with two former high draft picks and experienced starters in Russell Wilson and Jameis Winston, while the Giants also still have Tommy DeVito, who has started eight games in New York, on the roster too. Daboll sees some of the qualities in Dart that are necessary to compete, but he also cautions that it's very early in the process. \"I think he's got some natural leadership qualities,\" Daboll said. \"The biggest thing that you usually try to get out of a rookie camp, at least where I've been and I've worked for is kind of get to know (the players). \"It's very, very introductory ... kind of just starting at the beginning of the alphabet here.\" When asked by reporters about some of the team's other high-profile rookies, Daboll had no trouble pointing to the positives. He described No. 3 overall pick Abdul Carter as a \"good kid\" who is conscientious with a good attitude. He added that fourth-round selection Cam Skattebo is conscientious as well. \"I like the young guys we have, and I look forward to working with them,\" Daboll said. --Field Level Media",

    "content": "May 10 - New Orleans Saints quarterback Derek Carr is retiring from the NFL after 11 seasons due to a right shoulder injury. The Saints said Saturday that Carr had a labral tear and degenerative rotator cuff damage to his right throwing shoulder. Carr, 34, had been experiencing discomfort in his shoulder since sustaining a left hand injury during a game against the New York Giants on Dec. 8. \"Upon reflection of prayer, and in discussion with (wife) Heather, I've decided to retire from the National Football League,\" Carr said. \"For more than 11 years, we have been incredibly blessed, and we are forever grateful and humbled by this experience. It's difficult to find the right words to express our thanks to all the teammates, coaches, management, ownership, team officials and especially the fans who made this journey so special. Your unwavering support has meant the world to us.\" The Saints, in their statement, said Carr made the decision after consulting with medical experts. \"Surgery was an option, jeopardizing the entire 2025 season, yet there was no guarantee Derek would return to the level of strength, function and performance of play to which he was accustomed,\" the team said. The Saints selected quarterback Tyler Shough in the second round of the 2025 NFL Draft last month. They also have 2024 fifth-round pick Spencer Rattler and 2023 fourth-round selection Jake Haener on the roster. Carr was 14-13 as the starter in New Orleans over two seasons, although he was limited to 10 games in 2024 due to injuries. A four-time Pro Bowl selection, Carr has thrown for 41,245 yards and 257 touchdowns against 112 interceptions for the Oakland/Las Vegas Raiders (2014-22) and Saints. He was selected by the Raiders in the second round of the 2014 NFL Draft out of Fresno State. The Saints will look at all three of their in-house candidates in the search for a starter in coach Kellen Moore's first season at the helm. \"We're going to let all three of these guys roll and they've all earned these opportunities. We'll let Jake, Spencer and Tyler, all three, go through this process,\" Moore told reporters on Saturday. \"Again, we'll play patience, let these guys compete, let them get into training camp and naturally these (competitions will) take care of itself.\" Shough said he learned of Carr's retirement from Moore shortly before Saturday's morning practice. \"I think that's all you can ask for is an opportunity at any position and I'm going to treat it the same way, as if, whoever was on the roster, I've got to continue to grow and get better and do my best to elevate the quarterback room,\" Shough said. Rattler started six of seven games played for the Saints last season and passed for 1,317 yards, four touchdowns and five interceptions. Haener played in eight games (one start) last season and threw for 226 yards, one touchdown and one interception. --Field Level Media",

    "content": "MADRID, May 10 (Reuters) - Atletico Madrid striker Alexander Sorloth scored four goals inside 30 minutes, including the fastest hat-trick in LaLiga history, in a 4-0 home win over Real Sociedad on Saturday. The Norwegian forward completed his treble in the opening 11 minutes, the earliest ever in the competition, before adding a fourth goal to seal the rout on the half-hour. Atletico, who are out of the title race, sit third on 70 points, nine adrift of leaders Barcelona and five behind Real Madrid who face off in a potential title decider on Sunday. Real Sociedad have not won any of their last five league games and are 12th with 43 points. Atletico, who were held to a0-0 drawat relegation-threatened Alaves last weekend, took the lead after seven minutes when Sorloth scored after a long pass by Pablo Barrios. The 29-year-old doubled the advantage three minutes later with a strike from the edge of the box into the bottom corner. He got the record-breaking third a little over 60 seconds later with a close-range effort into the roof of the net. Sorloth's hat-trick was four minutes faster than Edmundo Suarez's in 1941 and Carles Bestit's in 1929. However, the striker did not stop there and made it 4-0 when he received the ball from Javi Galan on the edge of the box and paused to control it before slotting home. Sorloth became Atletico's leading scorer in LaLiga this season with 17 goals, two more than in-form striker Julian Alvarez who was suspended. The Norwegian previously scored four goals in a match in May last year, helping former team Villarreal hold champions Real Madrid to a 4-4 draw when it took him 56 minutes. Sorloth also hit the bar from near the penalty spot early in the second half as Atletico continued to dominate, with Sociedad now having failed to score in three straight league games.",

    "content": "ISLAMABAD/NEW DELHI, May 10 (Reuters) - Nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire on Saturday afterU.S. pressureand four days of fighting, but within hours explosions rang out in border cities and towns and India accused Pakistan of violating the pact. Artillery fire and attack drones were witnessed in Jammu and Kashmir, the centre of much of the fighting, while blasts from air-defence systems boomed in cities under blackout, similar to the previous evening, according to authorities, residents and Reuters witnesses. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told reporters that Pakistan had violated the understanding arrived at by the two countries earlier in the day, and that the Indian armed forces had been instructed to \"deal strongly\" with any repetition. \"We call upon Pakistan to take appropriate steps to address these violations and deal with the situation with seriousness and responsibility,\" Misri told a media briefing. In response, the foreign ministry of Pakistan said the country was committed to the ceasefire and blamed India for the violations. \"Our forces are handling the situation with responsibility and restraint,\" it said. The ministry also called on troops on the ground to exercise restraint and said that any issues in the implementation of the ceasefire should be addressed through communication at appropriate levels. Pakistan's military spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The fighting has been the worst between the old South Asian enemies in nearly three decades and threatened to erupt into a full-scale war in one of the world's most volatile and densely populated regions. There were briefly fears that nuclear arsenals might come into play as Pakistan's military said a top body overseeing its nuclear weapons would meet. But the defence minister said no such meeting was scheduled, hours after a night of heavy fighting in which the two countries targeted each other’s military bases and the combined civilian death toll rose to 66. \"Pakistan and India have agreed to a ceasefire with immediate effect,\" Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar posted on X. \"Pakistan has always strived for peace and security in the region, without compromising on its sovereignty and territorial integrity!\" Misri had earlier said the chiefs of the two countries' military operations had spoken to each other and agreed that all fighting would stop at 5 p.m. Indian time (1130 GMT). U.S. PresidentDonald Trumpposted: \"After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence.\" Dar told the broadcaster Geo News that military channels and hotlines between India and Pakistan had been activated, and three dozen countries had helped to facilitate the agreement. On Wednesday, India had attacked what it said was \"terrorist infrastructure\" in Pakistani Kashmir and Pakistan, two weeks after 26 people were killed in an attack on Hindu tourists in Indian Kashmir. Pakistan denied India's accusations that it was involved in the attack. Days of cross-border fire, shelling and drone and missile attacks followed. Despite the truce, two Indian government sources told Reuters that the punitive measures announced by India and reciprocated by Pakistan, such as trade suspension and visa cancellations, would remain in place for now. The sources also said the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, a critical water-sharing pact that India suspended after the Kashmir attack,would remain suspended. The Indian foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that he and Vice President JD Vance had engaged with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistan's Shehbaz Sharif, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Pakistan's army chief Asim Munir, and the two national security advisers over the course of 48 hours. In a post on X, Rubio commended Modi and Sharif on the agreement, which he said included not only an immediate ceasefire but also the start of talks on \"a broad set of issues at a neutral site.” News of the ceasefire was greeted with relief on both sides of the border and Pakistan's airport authority said its airspace had been fully reopened. But the subsequent violations sparked alarm in India. \"What the hell just happened to the ceasefire? Explosions heard across Srinagar!!!\", Omar Abdullah, chief minister of Indian Kashmir, posted on X. \"This is no ceasefire. The air defence units in the middle of Srinagar just opened up.\" India and Pakistan have been locked in adispute over Kashmirever since they were born at the end of British colonial rule in 1947. Hindu-majority India and Muslim Pakistan both rule part of Kashmir but claim it in full. They have gone to war three times, including twice over Kashmir, alongside numerous smalleroutbreaks of fighting. India blames Pakistan for an insurgency in its part of Kashmir that began in 1989 and has killed tens of thousands. It also blames Pakistani Islamist militant groups for attacks elsewhere in India. Pakistan rejects both charges. It says it provides only moral, political and diplomatic support to Kashmiri separatists.",

    "content": "May 10 (Reuters) - World number one Jannik Sinner was ecstatic after a victorious return following a three-month doping ban, with a 6–3 6–4 win over Argentina's Mariano Navone in the second round of the Italian Open. Sinner agreed a settlement with the World Anti-Doping Agency in February and began an immediate three-month suspension after authorities accepted that the anabolic agent clostebol had entered his system via massages from his physiotherapist. For the three-times Grand Slam champion, who had not played since winning the Australian Open in January, was not about just winning on home soil but rebuilding momentum. \"It's an amazing feeling,\" said the 23-year-old. \"I waited quite long for this moment. I'm very happy to be back. \"It's very difficult to have the right feedback when you don't have any matches, and that's exactly what I need. Now I think the best practice is the match itself, so I'm very happy about that.\" Sinner admitted there was natural rust, but the joy of simply competing again overrode any doubts about sharpness or rhythm. \"I'm very happy about the win today. It was very difficult. (Navone) is such a great player, especially on this surface. I tried to move around the ball. \"At times it went very well, at times it could have been better, yes, but in any case, it doesn't matter about the result today. It has been a remarkable day for me, so I'm very happy.\" The Italian said he was surprised about how well his game felt after the layoff, as he extended his tour-level winning streak to 22 matches. \"I was surprised how things can (feel good) so quickly. I tried to give everything I have. I think that's the only thing I can do and that's the only thing I can control right now,\" Sinner said. \"The sensation felt quite good, to be honest. Of course, there were some ups and downs, that is normal, but (Navone) played some great tennis, especially when he broke me in the second set. \"I tried to accept that and tried to work again. Now I have some good feedback, and hopefully I can work with that.\" Sinner will next face lucky loser Jesper de Jong.",

    "content": "May 10 - The Detroit Tigers placed right-handed pitcher Casey Mize on the 15-day injured list on Saturday with a left hamstring strain. The move is retroactive to May 9. Mize was strong in a 10-2 victory over the Colorado Rockies on Thursday, allowing one earned run with eight strikeouts and no walks in six innings. However, late in the outing he reportedly felt a sensation in his hamstring that was originally thought to be due to dehydration. The strain appears to be mild, per the Athletic. Mize, 28, was limited to 20 starts last season due to a left hamstring strain, including a stint on the 60-day IL in July and August. He missed most of the 2022 season and all of 2023 due to Tommy John surgery and back surgery. The No. 1 overall pick of the 2018 MLB Draft, Mize is 6-1 this season with a 2.53 ERA in seven starts. He is 15-20 with a 4.13 ERA in 68 games (66 starts) for Detroit. In a corresponding move, the Tigers recalled right-handed pitcher Chase Lee from Triple-A Toledo. A sixth-round pick by the Texas Rangers in the 2021 MLB Draft, Lee is 0-0 with a 1.42 ERA in 6.1 innings of work across six games for Detroit this season, his first in the majors.

    "title": "Juve boss Tudor rues late lapse but hails team's mentality in Lazio draw",
    "content": "May 10 (Reuters) - Juventus manager Igor Tudor was left frustrated but praised his team's effort after they were denied victory by a last-gasp Matias Vecino header in a 1-1 draw at Lazio in Serie A on Saturday in the race for Champions League qualification. Randal Kolo Muani put the fourth-placed visitors in front early in the second half only for the momentum to swing towards Lazio, who are level with Juve on 64 points in fifth, after Pierre Kalulu was shown a straight red card on the hour mark. Reduced to 10 men, Juve defended doggedly until Vecino's equaliser deep in stoppage time left Tudor ruing another costly lapse. \"We have to congratulate the lads, there is regret because we were one minute away from taking home the three points,\" Tudor told reporters. \"It was a solid performance, we'll take this point and focus on everyone we'll face this week after the difficulties we've had.\" Juve and Lazio are a point above sixth-placed AS Roma, who can move above them both into fourth spot when they visit third-placed Atalanta, who have 68 points, on Monday. Asked about the dismissal of 24-year-old Kalulu – his first career red card, just like 20-year-oldKenan Yildiz'sin their previous home match – Tudor pointed to the inexperience of a young squad still learning under pressure. \"Definitely, age and pressure go hand in hand and without experience it can happen,\" the Croatian coach said. \"We paid for these mistakes, but you learn quickly and look ahead.\" Tudor also addressed his decision to take off substitutes Vasilije Adzic and Francisco Conceicao for Dusan Vlahovic and Federico Gatti respectively, a move that raised eyebrows. \"I have to explain (the substitutions) because they’re always made for the good of the team,\" he said. \"I apologised to the two players – I don’t usually do that – but it was the right change. \"Gatti, in particular, deserves praise. He came off the bench without a single training session and showed his leadership.\" With injuries mounting in defence ahead of Juve's game at home to Udinese next week, Tudor remained calm and focused on the task. \"We'll prepare as best we can with what we have, but we're ready,\" he said. \"Let's see who recovers – we are missing three defenders. We'll get Yildiz back and assess the others. \"Today we showed the mentality of a big team – and we’ll need that again in the next two weeks.\"",

    "title": "Soccer-Southampton avoid dubious record with City draw, Brentford keep Europe hopes alive",
    "content": "SOUTHAMPTON, England, May 10 (Reuters) - Southampton gave their long-suffering fans something to cheer about with a surprise0-0 drawwith Manchester City on Saturday that saw the rock bottom team avoid tying Derby County as the worst Premier League side in history. Pep Guardiola's City remained third in the table on 65 points with two games remaining in their bid for Champions League qualification. Newcastle United and Chelsea, who meet on Sunday, are only two points behind. Nottingham Forest, who also have a game in hand, trail by four. Aston Villa breathed life into their Champions League hopes with a 1-0 victory over Bournemouth that lifted them to sixth, and just two points behind Manchester City, as the contest for a top-five finish remains wide open. Brentford's pursuit of a first-ever European qualification gained strength with their1-0 victoryover already-relegated Ipswich Town, while Brighton & Hove Albion claimed a2-0 winat Wolverhampton Wanderers to keep them within touching distance of playing in Europe next season. Fulham's hopes of European football next season are fading fast, however, after they slipped to a fourth league defeat in five games with a3-1 loss, opens new tabto Everton. Already-relegated Southampton had looked likely to equal Derby County's season-low tally of 11 points in 2007-08, but the draw moved them to 12 as their fans at a sun-drenched St Mary's Stadium sung loudly in celebration. Manchester City thoroughly dominated with 26 shots to the home side's two, but Southampton defended in numbers, particularly in the dying minutes, to deny them. Their game plan drew criticism from City's Ruben Dias. \"It's frustrating to play against a team like them. They don't even try to play, just wasting time the whole game,\" he told Sky Sports. \"They are just sitting around. We tried every way... but we didn't score.\" Southampton goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale was proud of his team. \"We've had a tough, tough season, we've had tough Monday mornings after heavy defeats,\" Ramsdale told Sky Sports. \"Today we put smiles on the Southampton fans' faces. It's just a relief to be honest.\" Villa's Ollie Watkins flicked in a first-half winner, taking him ahead of Gabriel Agbonlahor as the club's all-time scorer with 75 league goals. \"I think it is massive for us,\" Watkins told Sky. \"There are a lot of teams that are pushing for Champions League spots and it is going down to the wire. Getting that goal to break the record for this club is massive and something I had my eye on when I came to the club.\" The visitors had Jacob Ramsey sent off for a second yellow card in the 80th to set up a nervous finish as late-goal specialists Bournemouth finally came to life but could not find an equaliser. Bournemouth, who could have moved up to eighth, remain in 10th spot with their outside challenge for Europe running out of steam. At Portman Road, Brentford won their fourth in a row on a first-half header by Kevin Schade to leave them eighth in the table with 55 points, while Ipswich are 18th. Schade scored in the 18th minute when he met Bryan Mbeumo's corner and steered the ball into the far corner. \"I see a strong team on form, we have got the momentum which is important. We are close to finishing eighth which would be the best position ever in the league. We are laser focused,\" Brentford manager Thomas Frank told the BBC. At Wolverhampton, goals from Danny Welbeck and substitute Brajan Gruda saw Brighton move up one place to ninth, level on 55 points with Brentford. Wolves fell to 14th. Should Manchester City defeat Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final this month, an eighth-place league finish would secure qualification for the Conference League. \"I think we were up against a good side and they're in good form. We had a gameplan and we played it out well,\" Welbeck told Premier League Productions. Fulham's loss at Craven Cottage saw them remain 11th in the table with 51 points from 36 games, four points adrift of eighth place, while Everton climbed one spot to 13th. Raul Jimenez gave Fulham a deserved lead in the first half with a powerful header before Vitaliy Mykolenko's deflected shot from the edge of the box levelled the score on the stroke of halftime. Two goals in three minutes from Michael Keane and Beto, who profited from an error by goalkeeper Bernd Leno, turned the game in Everton's favour in the second half and dealt their host's European dreams a heavy blow. \"It is the story of the last three or four games,\" Fulham manager Marco Silva told BBC. \"Goals have come from set-pieces. We have to be willing to fight, do our job well and we didn't. It's about concentration and focus.\" (This story has been refiled to fix a typo in Ruben Dias' surname in paragraph 8)",

The 1983 European Cup winners, once nicknamed the Bundesliga 'dinosaurs' for having been in the top division for the longest uninterrupted spell since the league's creation in 1963, suffered a shock first ever relegation in 2018.

Ulm stunned the hosts with a seventh minute lead through Tom Gaal but Hamburg bounced back just three minutes later to level with Ludovit Reis. Ulm then saw Semir Telalovic' 36th minute penalty saved by Hamburg keeper Daniel Heuer Fernandes before the hosts struck twice late in the first half through Ransford-Yeboah Koenigsdoerffer's superb chip and Davie Selke's 22nd league goal to earn a commanding lead. They picked up where they left off and made it 4-1 thanks to Philipp Strompf's own goal in the 49th before Koenigsdoerffer bagged his second with a solo effort and low drive from the edge of the box. Daniel Efadli made it half a dozen in the 86th as fans gathered around the pitch to storm it on the final whistle. With one game remaining, Hamburg are top on 59 points, with Cologne second on 58 and Elversberg third on 55. The third-placed team goes into a promotion/relegation playoff with the 16th team of the Bundesliga. Ulm are relegated to the third division.",

He said the cause of the fire might have been a lithium battery. Trains which were due to pass through the area were held up, roads were blocked and other events were cancelled.

Should Manchester City defeat Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final this month, an eighth-place finish would secure qualification for the Conference League. \"We are in a worse position than we were a couple of hours ago but we have to keep fighting,\" manager Andoni Iraola told Sky Sports television. Watkins' goal was his 75th in the league for Villa, taking him ahead of Gabriel Agbonlahor as the club's all-time top scorer in the Premier League era. \"I’ve had eyes on breaking that record since joining the club; you need to celebrate wins like that as it’s a great achievement,\" he said. Unai Emery's side, beaten by finalists Paris St Germain in this year's Champions League quarter-finals, had two chances before Watkins' breakthrough, with Marco Asensio hitting the post in the 43rd with an effort that fired up his side. Bournemouth goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga then had to make a double save from a Boubacar Kamara header and Matty Cash who nodded back the rebound. Bournemouth, starting with three changes from the Arsenal game, had only one shot on target in a first half with only two more shots than yellow cards (five). The response to the goal was tame for much of the second half but the hosts came alive after Ramsey walked. Antoine Semenyo shot wide in the 81st and Evanilson had a header palmed away by Emiliano Martinez. Semenyo then had an effort cleared off the line by Cash under pressure after a save from Martinez five minutes into stoppage time.",

    "content": "MUNICH, Germany, May 10 (Reuters) - Champions Bayern Munich eased past Borussia Moenchengladbach 2-0 in the Bundesliga on Saturday as club icon Thomas Mueller bid farewell in his final home game after 25 years at the club. The 35-year-old Mueller, who came through the Bayern youth ranks to win dozens of titles including a record 13 league crowns and two Champions League titles, was the first to lift the trophy aloft at the end of the game after captain Manuel Neurer handed it to him. \"I loved being a modern gladiator,\" Mueller told the crowd. \"But I am not sad. I look forward to what is ahead even though it won't be half as good. \"We all knew this moment would come. For many, including myself, it is a tough moment but a beautiful one too. The appreciation you gave me is unique.\" He was the focus even before the start, enjoying a brief farewell ceremony with club bosses, complete with flowers and a picture of him and all the trophies, ahead of his 750th game for Bayern in all competitions. But it was Gladbach who were in control at the start and in more of an attacking mood. Bayern, who secured their34th German league titlelast week, struck against the run of play when Bundesliga top scorer Harry Kane's header slightly deflected Michael Olise's shot in the 31st minute for the England captain's 25th league goal. Kane, who has now won the first club title of his career, is on track to become the first player in Bundesliga history to win the top scorer title in both of his first two campaigns, with one game left to play in the season. \"Incredible feeling,\" Kane said in between traditional beer showers from team mates. \"It was a long time coming. Lots of hard work and sacrifices for moments like this to celebrate with the fans. Hopefully first of many, we have a great team and a great coach,\" he said. Bayern, whose coach Vincent Kompany celebrated a league title in his first season in charge, eased up after the break and would have paid the price but for Manuel Neuer's successful comeback from injury with a string of saves. Olise made sure of the win in the 90th minute, shortly after Mueller came off to a standing ovation.",

Lazio, who are on a seven-game unbeaten league run, had their first attempt on target through Fisayo Dele-Bashiru in the third minute but his low effort at the near post was kept out by goalkeeper Michele Di Gregorio. The first half was largely short on action after that but following the break Weston McKennie crossed from the left and French forward Kolo Muani put the visitors in front. However, Igor Tudor's side were down to 10 men shortly afterwards when Kalulu was shown a straight red card for lashing out at Castellanos. Lazio were on the front foot from then on and Juve's Manuel Locatelli had to clear Pedro's effort with about 15 minutes left before Di Gregorio saved Mario Gila's header after a corner. The hosts were then awarded a penalty just before the end after Juventus keeper brought Castellanos down chasing after the ball near the goal line on the right side of the box. However, the referee reversed his decision after a VAR check showed the Argentina forward was offside. Di Gregorio then made another great save to keep out a Castellanos header late in added time but had no chance when Vecino pounced on a rebound to score from close range. Juve were still withoutsuspended striker Kenan Yildizand only had nine players on the bench, with midfielder Teun Koopmeiners and defender Andrea Cambiaso also out injured.",

    "title": "New Jersey mayor charged with trespassing at US immigration detention center",
    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - The mayor of Newark, New Jersey, a Democrat who is running for governor, was arrested on Friday on a charge of trespassing at a privately run federal immigration detention center while three U.S. lawmakers were on site for an unannounced inspection, officials said. Mayor Ras Baraka was taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in a scuffle at the gate to the ICE facility in Newark during the visit by three members of New Jersey's congressional delegation, according to a spokesperson for one of them, U.S. Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman. The spokesperson, Ned Cooper, told Reuters that Coleman and her two fellow Democratic colleagues, Representatives LaMonica McIver and Robert Menendez Jr., were also \"shoved around a bit\" in the fracas, but no one was believed to have been hurt. Alina Habba, a former lawyer to President Donald Trump serving as acting U.S. attorney, said on social media outlet X that Baraka \"committed trespass and ignored multiple warnings\" to leave the ICE facility, known as Delaney Hall. Appearing later on Fox News, Habba also accused Baraka of \"grandstanding.\" Baraka, who was held at a nearby ICE field office after his arrest, was later charged with a single count of trespassing, according to a criminal complaint filed by Habba's office. The mayor was released at about 8 p.m., after some seven hours in custody. In remarks to a crowd of supporters after he was freed, Baraka said he \"didn't do anything wrong\" and had gone to Delaney Hall \"to support my Congress people.\" He urged the crowd to disperse peacefully. A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency of ICE, said members of Congress were part of a group of demonstrators who tried to force their way into the facility when a bus of detainees arrived. “These members of Congress storming into a detention facility goes beyond bizarre political stunt and puts the safety of our law enforcement agents and the detainees at risk,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. Cooper said Watson Coleman, McIver and Menendez paid an unannounced visit to the detention center \"exercising their oversight roles as members of Congress,\" and that ICE was obligated to grant them admission. Allegations that lawmakers stormed the facility are \"factually not true,\" Cooper said, adding that Baraka remained outside the fence around the grounds to the facility, where he \"has been continually showing up\" in recent days. Cooper said the lawmakers were not part of or coordinated with a separate protest that was taking place at the facility, and had not coordinated their visit with the mayor. According to Cooper's account, the lawmakers were escorted through the gate but were initially denied entry to Delaney Hall itself. After speaking with guards, they noticed a crowd converging around the mayor, and a physical altercation ensued that led to his arrest. The lawmakers ultimately were admitted to the building and left about three hours after their arrival, Cooper said. Baraka is running for the Democratic nomination as New Jersey's governor in a competitive field. The primary is scheduled for next month. Immigrant rights advocates allege that Delaney Hall, a 1,000-person detention center operated by the private prison company GEO Group(GEO.N), opens new tab, lacked proper city permits and opened despite opposition from the community and elected officials. DHS denied the facility lacked proper permits and highlighted cases of alleged gang members and criminals being held there. \"Delaney Hall operated as a federal immigration processing center for six years under President Obama’s administration, without opposition from local political leaders,\" GEO Group said in a statement. It added that the facility has \"created hundreds of unionized jobs\" and is expected to contribute $50 million to the local economy.",

Wesneski was sent to the IL with right elbow discomfort, while fellow right-hander Logan VanWey was recalled from Triple-A Sugar Land. The IL move was made retroactive to Wednesday, one day after Wesneski gave up a season-high four runs on five hits in four innings against the Milwaukee Brewers. Wesneski, 27, is 1-3 with a 4.50 ERA in six starts this season. Wesneski is 10-16 in parts of four major league seasons with a 4.01 ERA in 74 appearances (28 starts).

Arnold replaced Spaniard Jesus Casas whose contract was terminated by the local soccer governing body in the wake of a 2-1 loss to Palestine in March. That result left the Iraqis in third place in the standings in Group B, four points adrift of leaders South Korea and one behind Jordan with two games left. The top two nations in each of Asia's three qualifying groups advance automatically for the World Cup while the teams in third and fourth progress to another round of preliminaries. “What is important is we all believe we can win the next two games, that is my first objective for Iraq,” he said.

Araqchi was speaking in Dohaa day aheadof another round of planned nuclear talks between Iran and the U.S. in Oman. \"If the goal of the negotiations is to deprive Iran of its nuclear rights, I state clearly that Iran will not back down from any of its rights,\" state media quoted Araqchi as saying. Iran has repeatedly said its right to enrich uranium is non-negotiable and has ruled out a \"zero enrichment\" demand by some U.S. officials. But U.S. President Donald Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, said in aninterviewon Friday that Iran's \"enrichment facilities have to be dismantled\" under any accord with the United States. Trump, who withdrew Washington from a 2015 deal between Tehran and world powers meant to curb its nuclear activity, hasthreatened to bombIran if no new deal is reached to resolve the long unresolved dispute. Western countries say Iran's nuclear programme, which Tehran accelerated after the U.S. walkout from the now moribund 2015 accord, is geared toward producing weapons, whereas Iran insists it is purely for civilian purposes. \"In its indirect talks with the United States, Iran emphasizes its right to peaceful use of nuclear energy and clearly declares that it is not seeking nuclear weapons,\" Araqchi said. \"Iran continues negotiations in good faith, and if the goal of these talks is to ensure the non-acquisition of nuclear weapons, an agreement is possible. However, if the aim is to limit Iran’s nuclear rights, Iran will never retreat from its rights.\"",

    "content": "May 10 (Reuters) - Camogie players in Sweden have turned the clock back by wearing a kit from a bygone age in a show of solidarity with colleagues in Ireland currently protesting for the right to wear shorts. The Irish sport hit the headlines this week for all the wrong reasons with players, tired of a rule outlawing the wearing of shorts, ramping upprotests, ultimately leading to the latepostponementof Saturday's Munster final. Camogie is the female version of hurling, a ball sport played with wooden sticks, often likened to a mix between lacrosse and hockey, with a little rugby thrown in because of its physicality. Wherever you go in the world, from Uganda to Vietnam, you are likely to find people playing Ireland's national sports. Sweden is no different, and Irishwoman Michelle Cotter set up the hurling and camogie teams at Stockholm Gaels. \"The goal was to do something over here to show the players back home that their impact is reaching much further than the island of Ireland,\" Cotter told Reuters. The Camogie Association of Ireland's rules state that playing gear must include skirt, skort or divided skirt, but a recentsurveyshowed that 83% of players want the choice to include shorts. The Stockholm club, which includes not only Irish players and local Swedes but women from Australia, Austria, the U.S., Britain, France and Spain, took things back to even before the days of skorts, when players wore skirts down to their ankles. The first set of camogie rules, drawn up in 1903, stated skirts should be worn no more than six inches from the ground and, while things have improved, two motions to introduce shorts were defeated at last year's Camogie Association congress. \"Given none of us even own skorts, we togged out for training in skirts and dresses,\" Cotter, who also coaches and plays on the team, said. \"It felt every bit as ridiculous as it looked.\" There is still hope for change following all the media attention and controversy of the past week, after the association agreed to hold a special congress on May 22to voteagain on a motion to allow the wearing of shorts.",

    "content": "NEW DELHI, May 10 (Reuters) - India and Pakistanagreed to a ceasefireon Saturday after U.S.-led diplomacy, but hours later India said that Pakistan hadviolatedthe truce. Here's how the conflict unfolded between the two nuclear-armed neighbors and where it stands now: After four days of intense military exchanges, India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire on Saturday, facilitated by U.S.-led diplomatic efforts. The ceasefire came amid heightened fears that the conflict could escalate into a broader confrontation, with both nations on high alert. But within hours,violationswere reported from the main cities of Indian Kashmir, the territory that had borne the brunt of four days of fighting. The Indian armed forces were responding to ceasefire violations by Pakistan hours after the truce was reached on Saturday, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told a press briefing in New Delhi. The current hostilities began after a deadly April 22 attack targeting Hindu tourists inIndian Kashmir, which left 26 people dead. India blamed Pakistan-based militant groups for the assault, prompting New Delhi to launch air strikes earlier this week on what it described as \"terrorist infrastructure\" within Pakistan. Pakistan, which denies involvement in the Kashmir attack, condemned the strikes and vowed to retaliate. India said it struck nine \"terrorist camps\" in Pakistan on Wednesday, claiming these sites were indoctrination centers, training grounds, and launchpads for attacks. Some of these, according to Indian officials, were linked to theperpetratorsof last month's violence. Pakistan said the Indian attacks hit six locations in its territory, none of them militant camps. Pakistan initially claimed it shot down five Indian fighter jets during the first wave of strikes, a claim the Indian embassy in Beijing dismissed as \"misinformation.\" In response tosubsequent escalations, Pakistan said it shot down 25 Indian drones overnight, including some over its largest cities, Karachi and Lahore. India, meanwhile, stated that it had \"neutralized\" Pakistani attempts to strike military targets with drones and missiles, including targeting air defense systems in Pakistan. Global leaders havewelcomedthe de-escalation between India and Pakistan. U.S. President Donald Trump credited American diplomatic efforts and described it as a result of \"a long night of talks\" mediated by the United States. European Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas welcomed the ceasefire as a \"vital step toward de-escalation,\" while British Foreign Minister David Lammy urged both sides to maintain it. The ceasefire agreement marks a significant step back from the brink of a major conflict. However, despite the agreement, theIndus Waters Treaty, a key water-sharing pact between the two countries remains suspended, four government sources told Reuters. Two Indian government sources also told Reuters that otherpunitive measuresannounced by India and reciprocated by Pakistan, such as trade suspension and visa cancellations, would remain in place for now.",

When you play that many close matches and get this close and also play some of your best tennis and lose, I think you learn a lot,\" Collins said. \"I feel like I applied that today, to the match.\" Five-times Grand Slam champion Swiatek went 5-0 down in the opening set before getting on the board to avoid a bagel. Collins was lethal from the baseline, mixing it up with forehand and backhand service return winners as she picked apart Swiatek's serve in an opening set that was one-way traffic. The second was level at 4-4 as Swiatek showed flashes of brilliance, but 31-year-old 2022 Australian Open runner-up Collins showed no mercy, sealing victory in one hour and 44 minutes when a return went wide. Collins fired 32 winners and converted six of eight break points while Swiatek, who had won the tournament three times in the last four years, made 22 unforced errors. Swiatek has lost nine matches this year - as many as in all of 2024 - while she has not reached a claycourt final ahead of her bid to retain the French Open title later this month. \"It hasn't been easy,\" she told reporters. \"For sure, I'm doing something wrong. So I need to just regroup and change some stuff. I had some advice from the team, I'll just try to do this. \"I think I just wasn't there, present, to fight and to compete (against Collins). I focused on mistakes. It's my mistake and I'm not doing things right. So the focus is on the wrong things from my side and I'll try to change that. \"I'm not able to play my game. I'll just try to change my mindset a little bit.\"",

I also wanted this stage victory in Cotobello,\" Vollering said. \"I decided to wait for as long as possible to launch my attack. It was hard to wait, but I'm happy that I won the way I did.

    "title": "Explosions reported after India and Pakistan agree to ceasefire",
    "content": "ISLAMABAD/NEW DELHI, May 10 (Reuters) - Nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire on Saturday afterU.S. pressureand four days of fighting, but within hours explosions rang out in border cities and towns and India accused Pakistan of violating the pact. Artillery fire and attack drones were witnessed in Jammu and Kashmir, the centre of much of the fighting, while blasts from air-defence systems boomed in cities under blackout, similar to the previous evening, according to authorities, residents and Reuters witnesses. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told reporters that Pakistan had violated the understanding arrived at by the two countries earlier in the day, and that the Indian armed forces had been instructed to \"deal strongly\" with any repetition. \"We call upon Pakistan to take appropriate steps to address these violations and deal with the situation with seriousness and responsibility,\" Misri told a media briefing. In response, the foreign ministry of Pakistan said the country was committed to the ceasefire and blamed India for the violations. \"Our forces are handling the situation with responsibility and restraint,\" it said. The ministry also called on troops on the ground to exercise restraint and said that any issues in the implementation of the ceasefire should be addressed through communication at appropriate levels. Pakistan's military spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The fighting has been the worst between the old South Asian enemies in nearly three decades and threatened to erupt into a full-scale war in one of the world's most volatile and densely populated regions. There were briefly fears that nuclear arsenals might come into play as Pakistan's military said a top body overseeing its nuclear weapons would meet. But the defence minister said no such meeting was scheduled, hours after a night of heavy fighting in which the two countries targeted each other’s military bases and the combined civilian death toll rose to 66. \"Pakistan and India have agreed to a ceasefire with immediate effect,\" Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar posted on X. \"Pakistan has always strived for peace and security in the region, without compromising on its sovereignty and territorial integrity!\" Misri had earlier said the chiefs of the two countries' military operations had spoken to each other and agreed that all fighting would stop at 5 p.m. Indian time (1130 GMT). U.S. PresidentDonald Trumpposted: \"After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence.\" Dar told the broadcaster Geo News that military channels and hotlines between India and Pakistan had been activated, and three dozen countries had helped to facilitate the agreement. On Wednesday, India had attacked what it said was \"terrorist infrastructure\" in Pakistani Kashmir and Pakistan, two weeks after 26 people were killed in an attack on Hindu tourists in Indian Kashmir. Pakistan denied India's accusations that it was involved in the attack. Days of cross-border fire, shelling and drone and missile attacks followed. Despite the truce, two Indian government sources told Reuters that the punitive measures announced by India and reciprocated by Pakistan, such as trade suspension and visa cancellations, would remain in place for now. The sources also said the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, a critical water-sharing pact that India suspended after the Kashmir attack,would remain suspended. The Indian foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that he and Vice President JD Vance had engaged with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistan's Shehbaz Sharif, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Pakistan's army chief Asim Munir, and the two national security advisers over the course of 48 hours. In a post on X, Rubio commended Modi and Sharif on the agreement, which he said included not only an immediate ceasefire but also the start of talks on \"a broad set of issues at a neutral site.” News of the ceasefire was greeted with relief on both sides of the border and Pakistan's airport authority said its airspace had been fully reopened. But the subsequent violations sparked alarm in India. \"What the hell just happened to the ceasefire? Explosions heard across Srinagar!!!\", Omar Abdullah, chief minister of Indian Kashmir, posted on X. \"This is no ceasefire. The air defence units in the middle of Srinagar just opened up.\" India and Pakistan have been locked in adispute over Kashmirever since they were born at the end of British colonial rule in 1947. Hindu-majority India and Muslim Pakistan both rule part of Kashmir but claim it in full. They have gone to war three times, including twice over Kashmir, alongside numerous smalleroutbreaks of fighting. India blames Pakistan for an insurgency in its part of Kashmir that began in 1989 and has killed tens of thousands. It also blames Pakistani Islamist militant groups for attacks elsewhere in India. Pakistan rejects both charges. It says it provides only moral, political and diplomatic support to Kashmiri separatists.",

    "title": "Exclusive: Iran to send Russia launchers for short-range missiles, sources say",
    "content": "WASHINGTON/LONDON May 9 (Reuters) - (This May 9 story has been corrected to clarify that Iran's statement came from its permanent mission to the United Nations, not the United States, in paragraph 8) Iran is preparing to deliver in the near future launchers for short-range ballistic missiles that the U.S. said Tehran sent to Russia last year for use against Ukraine, according to two Western security officials and a regional official. Iran denied it had such plans and dismissed the idea as \"utterly absurd\". The delivery of the Fath-360 launchers - if it occurs - would help support Russia's grinding assault on its neighbor and reaffirm the deepening security ties between Moscow and Tehran. With a 75-mile (120-km) range, the Fath-360 would give Moscow's forces a new weapon to fire at Ukrainian frontline troops, nearby military targets, and population centers close to the border with Russia, analysts said. The U.S. last Septembersaidthat Iran delivered the missiles to Russia on nine Russian-flagged ships - which it sanctioned - and three sourcestoldReuters at that time that the launchers were not included. The Western security officials and the regional official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the delivery of the Fath-360 launchers was imminent. They declined to provide further details of the pending transfer, including why they thought the launchers were not delivered with the missiles. Iran's permanent mission to the United Nations dismissed what it called \"baseless allegations\" against Tehran. \"So long as conflict persists between the parties, Iran will abstain from rendering any form of military assistance to either side,\" it said in an emailed statement. Russia's defense ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The U.S. National Security Council referred inquiries to the State Department, which did not respond immediately. The CIA declined comment. Russia and Iran have previously denied that Tehran had shipped the missiles or any other arms to aid the full-scale invasion of Ukraine that Moscow launched in February 2022. U.S., Ukrainian and European officials say Iran has provided Russia thousands of drones and artillery shells. In an apparent reference to the Fath-360s, U.S. Army General Christopher Cavoli, the commander of U.S. Central Command, last month told U.S. lawmakers that Iran had donated to Russia more than 400 short-range ballistic missiles. There have been no public reports of Iran transferring any other kinds of short-range ballistic missiles to Moscow or of Russian forces using the Fath-360. Russia's deployment of the missiles could complicate U.S. President Donald Trump's efforts toarrange, opens new taba ceasefire and peace talks between Ukraine and Russia and to strike a separate deal with Iran to curb its nuclear program. The regional official said that the indirect U.S.-Iran nuclear talks mediated by Oman are among \"several reasons\" for the delayed delivery of the launchers. The talks have encountered turbulence, although Iran on Fridaysaidit agreed to hold a fourth round in Oman on Sunday. Jack Watling, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute think tank, said that Iranian officials would consider the issue of sending arms to Russia as separate from the nuclear talks. \"That the Iranians are negotiating on nuclear issues with the U.S. will not be seen as connected to what they might do in collaboration with the Russians,\" he said. Analysts said there could have been another complication: Iran had to modify European-made commercial trucks on which to mount the launchers for its own Fath-360 arsenal, and it may have had to do the same for Russia given its massive losses of vehicles in Ukraine. With the launchers, Russia will be able to increase pressure on Ukraine, said the experts. \"It would be much easier (for Russian forces) to launch a strike much faster ... against high-value targets,\" said Fabian Hinz, a research fellow with the International Institute for Strategic Studies. \"They (Fath-360s) don't need a lot of launch preparations. Their flight time is incredibly short.\" Deploying the Fath-360 could allow Russia to reserve its more advanced missiles, like the Iskander, for longer-range strikes at critical infrastructure, including the power grid, straining Ukraine's precious missile defenses, the analysts said. The Fath-360 \"is designed to be handled and operated by people with relatively little training,\" said Ralph Savelsberg, an associate professor at the Netherlands Defense Academy. \"Why would they (Russia) buy inferior Iranian missiles? The only reason I could think of is that they cannot produce a sufficient number of their own missiles,\" he said. \"They're not super accurate and they don't carry a very large payload. But it just adds to Ukraine's headaches.\"",

    "content": "WASHINGTON, May 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. House committee in charge of taxes released on Friday evening a partial text of its part of PresidentDonald Trump's proposed tax agenda that would make his 2017 tax cuts permanent, leaving out contentious issues before a planned vote on Tuesday. The 28-page proposal by the House Ways and Means Committee would increase the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,500 through 2028 and to $2,000 after, and adds a requirement for recipients to have a Social Security number and reduces some taxes for multinational companies and unincorporated businesses. But it does not address more hotly contested issues like what to do with the current $10,000 deduction limit for state and local taxes, which is important to states with high taxes like New York, California and New Jersey. It also does not address the fate of Medicaid, which covered about 35 million people in states Trump won in last year's presidential election and clean energy tax credits that benefit some Republican states. \"Ways and Means Republicans have spent two years preparing for this moment, and we will deliver for the American people,” said Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith of Missouri. U.S. congressional Republicans are struggling over how to pay for what Trump has called his \"big, beautiful bill\" - a multitrillion-dollar tax-cut and immigration reform agenda, with the fate of the Medicaid healthcare program and the nation's debt ceiling hanging in the balance. The party is torn between hardliners who want tax cuts to be scaled back to achieve a goal of $2 trillion in spending reductions over the next decade and moderates pushing back against large-scale slashing of the Medicaid healthcare program. Ways and Means is scheduled to hold a meeting to debate and advance the legislation on Tuesday afternoon.",

    "title": "Exclusive: Qataris search for bodies of Americans killed by Islamic State in Syria",
    "content": "May 10 (Reuters) - A Qatari mission has begun searching for the remains of U.S. hostages killed by Islamic State in Syria a decade ago, two sources briefed on the mission said, reviving a longstanding effort to recover their bodies. Islamic State, which controlled swathes of Syria and Iraq at the peak of its power from 2014-2017, beheaded numerous people in captivity, including Western hostages, and released videos of the killings. Qatar's international search and rescue group began the search on Wednesday, accompanied by several Americans, the sources said. The group, deployed by Doha to earthquake zones in Morocco and Turkey in recent years, had so far found the remains of three bodies, the sources said. One of the sources - a Syrian security source - said the remains had yet to be identified. The second source said it was unclear how long the mission would last. The U.S. State Department had no immediate comment. The Qatari mission gets under way as U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to visit Doha and other Gulf Arab allies next week and as Syria's ruling Islamists, close allies of Qatar,seek relieffrom U.S. sanctions. The Syrian source said the mission's initial focus was on looking for the body of aid worker Peter Kassig, who was beheaded by Islamic State in 2014 in Dabiq in northern Syria. The second source said Kassig's remains were among those they hoped to find. In a statement, the Kassig family said it was waiting for analysis seeking to confirm the identities of the dead. \"We are grateful to all those who are involved in the effort to get these deceased individuals' remains identified and returned to their home countries and loved ones,\" it said. U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff were among other Western hostages killed by Islamic State. Their deaths were confirmed in 2014. U.S. aid worker Kayla Mueller was also killed in Islamic State captivity. She was raped repeatedly by Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi before her death, U.S. officials have said. Her death was confirmed in 2015. \"We’re grateful for anyone taking on this task and risking their lives in some circumstances to try and find the bodies of Jim and the other hostages,\" said Diane Foley, James Foley's mother. \"We thank all those involved in this effort.\" The jihadists were eventually driven out of their self-declared caliphate by a U.S.-led coalition and other forces. Plans for the Qatari mission were discussed during a visit to Washington in April by Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and the Minister of State for the foreign ministry, Mohammed Al Khulaifi - a trip also designed to prepare for Trump's visit to Qatar, one of the sources said. Another person familiar with the issue said there had been a longstanding commitment by successive U.S. administrations to find the remains of the murdered Americans, and that there had been multiple previous \"efforts with U.S. government officials on the ground in Syria to search very specific areas.\" The person did not elaborate. But the U.S. has had hundreds of troops deployed in northeastern Syria that have continued pursuing the remnants of Islamic State. The person said the remains of Kassig, Sotloff and Foley were most likely in the same general area, and that Dabiq had been one of Islamic State's \"centrepieces\" - a reference to its propaganda value as a place named in an Islamic prophecy. Mueller's case differed in that she was in Baghdadi's custody, the person said. TwoIslamic State members, bothformer British citizenswho were part of a cell that beheaded American hostages, are serving life prison sentences in the United States. Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa, who seized power from Bashar al-Assad in December, battled Islamic State when he was the commander of another jihadist faction - the al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front - during the Syrian war. Sharaa severed ties to al Qaeda in 2016.",

    "content": "IPSWICH, England, May 10 (Reuters) - Brentford boosted their hopes of playing European football next season as they beat already-relegated Ipswich Town 1-0 thanks to a first-half header by Kevin Schade at Portman Road in the Premier League on Saturday. With four successive wins, Brentford are eighth in the standings with 55 points from 36 matches. Ipswich sit 18th on 22 points with just four wins. \"(Europe) is extremely exciting. There is a lot riding on the next few games. Let's see what happens, depending on other things and it is one game at a time and the next one is Fulham,\" Brentford manager Thomas Frank told Sky Sports. Ipswich had made a bright start to the game and came close to an opener after just three minutes but striker Liam Delap's header was comfortably saved by goalkeeper Mark Flekken. But it was Brentford who took the lead when Schade met a corner from fellow forward Bryan Mbeumo in the 18th minute, steering the ball into the far corner after some confusion in the box. German Schade has now scored four goals in his last three Premier League games, while Cameroon international Mbeumo became just the third player to be directly involved in more than 25 goals in the Premier League this season after Liverpool talisman Mohamed Salah and Newcastle United's Alexander Isak. Yoane Wissa nearly put Brentford 2-0 up minutes after the interval but the forward's effort was saved by goalkeeper Alex Palmer, who made another fine save to keep out Mbeumo's right-foot volley in the 73rd minute. Brentford, who kept up the pressure and constantly looked dangerous, were denied a penalty in the 69th minute after Axel Tuanzebe pulled fellow defender Nathan Collins to the ground. However, it was a far from comfortable afternoon for Brentford as Ipswich pushed for an equaliser late on with Flekken having to come to their rescue in added time when he made a brilliant point-blank save to deny centre back Cameron Burgess. \"We haven't given up and that is going to be really important to the next stage of the journey. We pushed really hard for the goal at the end and we didn't get it...,\" Ipswich manager Kieran McKenna told BBC Match of the Day. Brentford, who have never qualified for Europe, next host 11th-placed Fulham on May 18 before taking a trip to 14th-placed Wolverhampton Wanderers for their final game of the season on May 25.",

    "content": "May 10 - Justin Rose withdrew from the Truist Championship prior to Saturday's third round, citing an illness. Rose, a former World No. 1 golfer in the Official World Golf Ranking currently ranked No. 14, announced his decision over social media with respect to possibly getting healthier ahead of next week's PGA Championship. \"After becoming progressively ill over the past few days, I have made the unfortunate decision to withdraw from the (Truist Championship),\" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"I am not in a state to complete, and it's best for me to focus on a quick recovery prior to next week. \"Thanks to all the fans in Philly for the love this week. It's a special place to me and I'm sorry it wasn't a better week!\" Rose, 44, carded a 7-over-par 77 during the second round at the Philadelphia Cricket Club and was in last place at 7-over after 36 holes at the 72-man, no-cut event. The Englishman is an 11-time winner on the PGA Tour -- including the 2013 U.S. Open. He gave Rory McIlroy a run for his money at the recent Masters before falling short in a playoff. Also on Saturday, Michael Kim withdrew from the tournament during the third round because of a back injury. Kim was scheduled to play with Rose on Saturday after opening the tournament with two rounds of 72. \"Back wasn't great to start the week and aggravated it during the last two days,\" Kim wrote on X. \"[I] will get treatment and look to get back as soon as possible.\" Kim, 31, is 53rd in the Official World Golf Ranking. His win at the 2018 John Deere Classic is his lone victory on the PGA Tour. --Field Level Media",

    "title": "Everton dent Fulham’s European hopes with 3-1 away win",
    "content": "LONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - Fulham's hopes of European football next season are fading fast after they slipped to a fourth Premier League defeat in five games with a 3-1 loss to Everton at Craven Cottage on Saturday. Fulham stayed 11th in the table with 51 points from 36 games, four points behind eighth-placed Brentford, while Everton climbed one spot to 13th with 42. Raul Jimenez gave Fulham a deserved lead in the first half with a powerful header before Vitaliy Mykolenko’s deflected shot from the edge of the box levelled the scores on the stroke of halftime. Two goals in three minutes from Michael Keane and Beto, who profited from an error by goalkeeper Bernd Leno, turned the game in Everton's favour and dealt their host's European dreams a heavy blow. \"It is the story of the last three or four games,\" Fulham manager Marco Silva told BBC. \"Goals have come from set-pieces. We have to be willing to fight, do our job well and we didn't. It's about concentration and focus. \"We have to blame ourselves because it didn't happen before but it did in the last few weeks.\" Everton manager David Moyes was not impressed with his side's start. \"It didn't look (like Everton would win) after the first 25 minutes,\" Moyes said. \"I thought we were terrible on the ball but we stuck at it. We are a resilient crew and the players did a good job in the end.\" Everton will end their 133-year stay at Goodison Park with a home fixture against Southampton next Sunday. \"I have just said to the players we have the biggest game of the season next week, and we are all ready for it.\" The hosts took the lead with Jimenez's first goal in eight games as Emile Smith Rowe crossed from the left and the striker rose above Mykolenko to head past keeper Jordan Pickford. Everton drew level on the stroke of halftime when Leno's punch from a corner was weak and Mykolenko's shot from the edge of the box took a wicked deflection off Andreas Pereira. The visitors went ahead after 70 minutes when Dwight McNeil’s deep corner was headed home at the back post by Keane. Leno’s howler then allowed Everton to score a third three minutes later. Carlos Alcaraz led a quick counter-attack and after he slipped a pass to Beto, the striker’s first-time shot was tame but went through Leno's hands. Fulham had a penalty appeal waved away in the dying seconds for a Mykolenko handball. Referee Darren England was called over to the pitch-side screen but stuck with his original decision.",

    "title": "Welbeck, Gruda strike to give Brighton 2-0 win at Wolves",
    "content": "WOLVERHAMPTON, England, May 10 (Reuters) - Brighton & Hove Albion claimed a 2-0 win at Wolverhampton Wanderers in the Premier League on Saturday thanks to goals from Danny Welbeck and substitute Brajan Gruda, keeping them within touching distance of qualifying for European football. Brighton moved up one place to ninth on 55 points, level with eighth-placed Brentford. Should Manchester City defeat Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final this month, an eighth-place finish in the Premier League would secure qualification for the Conference League. \"I think we were up against a good side and they're in good form. We knew we were going to be up against a tough opponent. We had a gameplan and we played it out well,\" Welbeck told Premier League Productions. Wolves began well at Molineux but forward Goncalo Guedes, making his first league start since February, was unable to make the most of the two half-chances in the opening 10 minutes. The visitors thought they had taken the lead in the 23rd minute through a Welbeck volley, but the strike was disallowed after winger Yankuba Minteh was adjudged to have interfered with play while being in an offside position. Moments later, Brighton were awarded a penalty for a foul by Matheus Cunha on Mats Wieffer, and Welbeck stepped up to put the ball in the net and take his tally of league goals this season up to 10. \"(10 goals) is a good milestone to have and I feel like it could have been more. I'm looking forward to improving. We have two more games left and hopefully I'll get some more,\" Welbeck added. Wolves piled on the pressure in a desperate search for the equaliser, with Brighton keeper Bart Verbruggen saving Cunha's long-range shot before palming a dangerous cross away from Jorgen Strand Larsen. The game swung from end to end in the last 30 minutes and Brighton's forwards made frequent forays into Wolves' final third, but were often let down by their decision-making. One of Brighton's attacks finally worked out in the 85th minute, however, as German Gruda scored his first goal for the south-coast club, delicately dinking the ball over onrushing keeper Jose Sa after being played in by Simon Adingra. For Wolves, 14th in the table, the loss was another step backwards after last week's1-0 defeat by Manchester Cityended a run of six successive league victories. Vitor Pereira's side dropped to 14th in the table.",

Here is a chronology of major military anddiplomaticescalations in theirtroubledrelationship since 1999. May–July 1999: India and Pakistan fight an undeclared war in the Kargil region of Kashmir after Pakistani army-backed irregulars occupy Indian posts on the Line of Control (LoC), or ceasefire line. India pushes back after intense fighting. The U.S. pressures Pakistan to withdraw. December 2001: A heavily armed group attacks India's parliament building in New Delhi, killing nine people. IndiablamesPakistan-based Islamist groups Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba. The two countries come to the brink of a fourth war. November 2008: Ten heavily armed attackers target major landmarks across Mumbai, including two luxury hotels, a Jewish centre and the main train station, killing 166 people. India pauses all dialogue with Pakistan, resuming briefly years later under a structured peace process. January 2016: Attackers disguised as soldiersstorman Indian Air Force base near the Pakistan border, exchanging fire with Indian forces who, backed by tanks and helicopters, battle for more than 15 hours before wresting back control of the compound. All five assailants and at least two guards are killed. India says the attackers came from Pakistan, while Pakistani authorities condemn the raid. Peace talks, briefly revived in 2015, stall again. September 2016: Eighteen Indian soldiers arekilledin an attack on an army base in Uri in Indian Kashmir. India blames Pakistan for the attack and responds with \"surgical strikes\" across the LoC on what it calls terrorist launchpads. Pakistan denies any incursion on its territory. February 2019: A suicide bomberkills40 Indian paramilitary police in Kashmir. India conducts air strikes in Balakot, Pakistan. Pakistan responds with air strikes of its own and shoots down an Indian aircraft. India also claims to have shot down a Pakistani plane but this is not confirmed. The standoff cools following international pressure. August 2019: IndiarevokesKashmir's special status, scrapping a constitutional provision that allowed the state of Jammu and Kashmir to make its own laws.

    "title": "The Himalayan region of Kashmir, at the heart of India-Pakistan enmity",
    "content": "NEW DELHI, May 10 (Reuters) - India and Pakistan agreed to stop firing along their border on Saturday, bringing an end to the escalated tensions between the two arch-rivals after multiplestrikeswere launched against military bases. The Muslim-majority Himalayan region of Kashmir, which is claimed in full by both India and Pakistan, has been the site of several wars and diplomatic standoffs. Here is a look at the region, its history, and why it continues to be a source of tension between the two countries: After partition of the subcontinent in 1947 following independence from British rule, Kashmir was expected to become part of Pakistan, as with other Muslim-majority regions. Its Hindu ruler wanted it to stay independent but, faced with an invasion by Muslim tribesmen from Pakistan, acceded to India in October 1947 in return for help against the invaders. Kashmir ended up divided among Hindu-majority India, which governs the Kashmir Valley, Jammu and Ladakh; Islamic Pakistan, which controls Azad Kashmir (\"Free Kashmir\") and the Northern Areas; and China, which holds the Aksai Chin region. Indian-administered Kashmir has a population of around 7 million, of whom nearly 70% are Muslim. A provision of the Indian constitution, Article 370, provided for partial autonomy for Jammu and Kashmir. It was drafted in 1947 by the then-prime minister of the state, Sheikh Abdullah, and accepted by India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. Although intended as temporary, it was included in India's Constitution in 1949 by the constituent assembly. India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence, two of them over Kashmir in 1947 and 1965. A third in 1971 led to the creation of Bangladesh. In 1999, they clashed again in the Kargil region in what was described as an undeclared war. A U.N.-brokered ceasefire line, the Line of Control, now divides the region. Many Muslims in Indian Kashmir have long resented what they see as heavy-handed rule by India. In 1989, that bubbled over into an insurgency by Muslim separatists. India poured troops into the region and tens of thousands of people have been killed. India accuses Pakistan of arming and training militants, which Islamabad denies, saying it offers only moral and diplomatic support. In August 2019, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Indian government revoked Kashmir's semi-autonomous status in a move it said would better integrate the region with the rest of India. The state was reorganised into two federally administered union territories - Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. Pakistan strongly objected, downgrading diplomatic ties. Modi says his 2019 decision brought normality to Kashmir after decades of bloodshed. Violence has tapered off in recent years, according to Indian officials, with fewer large-scale attacks and rising tourist arrivals. Targeted killings of civilians and security forces are still reported, however. In 2024, Jammu and Kashmir held its first local elections since the 2019 revocation of autonomy. Several newly elected lawmakers urged a partial restoration of Article 370. Key regional parties boycotted or criticised the vote, saying the winners would not get any real political power. Tensions escalated after an attack on April 22 in the resort town of Pahalgam in Indian Kashmir in which 26 men, mostlyHindus, were killed. India identified two of the three suspected militants as Pakistanis, although Islamabad denied any role. Among a slew of tit-for-tat reprisals, India suspended the 1960 Indus Water Treaty regulating the sharing of water from the river and its tributaries. India launchedattackson May 7 on what it said were \"terrorist camps\" in Pakistan, including in Pakistani Kashmir. Strikes and counter-strikes against each side's military installations followed. On Saturday, May 10, after concerted U.S. diplomacy and pressure, the two nations said they had agreed to a \"full and immediate ceasefire\".",

    "title": "South Korea's conservatives settle on Kim Moon-soo after nomination turmoil exposes rifts",
    "content": "SEOUL, May 10 (Reuters) - South Korea's conservatives made another about-face on Saturday and reinstated their nominee, just hours after dropping him and reopening the nomination process as the divided party struggled for unity to challenge the liberal frontrunner in a presidential election four weeks away. People Power Party nominee Kim Moon-soo welcomed the decision, which was made after polling party members over whether to replace him with former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, whose late entry into the race derailed the consensus over its candidate for the snap June 3 presidential vote. \"Now everything will fall into place,\" he said in a statement, promising to seek unity and build a \"big tent\" coalition to take on liberal Democratic Party's candidate Lee Jae-myung when campaigning officially begins on Monday. Lee has been a clear frontrunner to replace conservative former President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was removed from office in April for violating his duties when he declared a short-lived martial law in December. Kim, who was selected as the conservatives' candidate in a party convention a week ago, resisted pressure from the party to step aside in favour of the more popular Han, who had declined to participate in the nomination process while he was still serving as prime minister. He spent the recent days openly clashing with PPP leadership and filing legal challenges against the party, including in the hours before he was reinstated. Kim said he was the sole legitimate candidate chosen under a democratic process. He filed for an injunctionto stop the party from reopening the nomination process but it was denied by a court on Friday, clearing the way for the conservatives to hold a new vote this weekend. He made another attempt on Saturday. Earlier on Saturday Kim told a press conference that the party's decision to hold a new vote was a \"political coup\" and accused it of violating internal procedures by attempting to replace him. \"Last night, democracy within our party died,\" Kim had said. \"Those responsible for this situation will be held accountable legally and politically.\" The People Power Party defended its moves, saying it had no alternative after the two candidates failed to unify behind a single choice. \"We deeply regret that it came to this, but it was unavoidable,\" Kwon Young-se, head of the party's emergency response committee, told a press conference. \"We believe there are no legal issues with the process.\" The party was racing to finalise its new nominee before the national election commission's formal registration for candidacy closes on Sunday. Han, who joined the People Power Party on Saturday after resigning as prime minister a week earlier, had also served as acting president following Yoon's ouster. The feud between the two prospective candidates has cast a shadow over the conservative party's already difficult battle to retain the presidency, while policy debates have taken a back seat. The liberal frontrunner has begun unveiling business policy proposals and national security initiatives onNorth Korea's military threat. Kim trails the liberal party's Lee by a wide margin in opinion polls. In two-way race scenarios, Lee has 43% support against Kim's 29%, according to a National Barometer Survey released on Thursday. Han was seen as doing better, but still far behind, at 34% vs Lee's 44%.",

    "content": "TIRANA, May 10 (Reuters) - Welshman Joshua Tarling (INEOS Grenadiers) set a time-trial pace even race favourite Primoz Roglic, could not match to win stage two of the Giro d'Italia by one second on Saturday. Tarling secured his first Grand Tour stage victory after the 21-year-old Briton had a nervous wait to see Roglic come so close, but the Slovenian had to settle for second place with the consolation of taking over the leader's pink jersey. Australian Jay Vine (UAE Team Emirates) had set the early pace but came in third, three second behind Tarling in the short 13.7km individual time-trial in Tirana. \"To win today is definitely exceptional,\" Tarling said. Vine crashed on Friday's opening stage, but took the lead from Italian Edoardo Affini, before Tarling showed his time-trial prowess. Tarling came third in the 2023 world road time-trial and, racing his first Giro, had to sit and watch as the main contenders attempted to steal the win. \"Waiting for the other riders to complete the course was hard too, I don't want to do it again,\" Tarling said. \"It was long. I was afraid of everyone among the favourites.\" All eyes were on 2023 winner Roglic, and with reigning champion Tadej Pogacar deciding to focus on the Tour de France, the 35-year-old Slovenian is expected to become the oldest ever Giro winner. Roglic, however, fell short, and Wout van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) was well off the pace early in his ride. Van Aert beat Tarling to the bronze medal at last year's Olympic Games. Opening stagewinner Mads Pedersen (Lidl-Trek) was last to go and despite pushing hard to the end, the Dane finished 12 seconds down in seventh place and lost the overall lead to Roglic by one second. Tarling, racing only his second Grand Tour having failed to finish last year's Vuelta A Espana, became the youngest rider to win a Giro time-trial. Sunday's stage three is the last time the riders will tackle the Albanian roads in this year's Giro, with a 160km ride that starts and finishes in Vlore.",

Real have a four-point gap to make up with four games remaining if they are to retain the title and for Ancelotti they will need to get everything right to have a chance on Sunday. \"In this type of game you have to do things well. Barcelona are used to keeping the opponent in their own area, but no team is perfect,\" he said. \"It's a game where there's a lot at stake and to win you have to manage everything well, defend well, attack well. We have to play a complete game.\" With so much at stake against their great rivals, Ancelotti will have little trouble getting his players fired up. \"It's not difficult to motivate the players because it's the type of match for which the players already come out motivated and with a lot of confidence,\" he said. \"Playing with Barcelona is special. It will be the last 'El Clasico' of the season because Barca are not in the Club World Cup. The speculation surrounding Ancelotti's future has only increased with the news that former Real playerXabi Alonsowill leave Bayer Leverkusen at the end of the season but, whatever happens, Real Madrid will remain dear to the Italian. \"What happens around us has not affected us at all,\" he said before adding: \"With this club the honeymoon does not end. \"Real Madrid and AC Milan before it are clubs that stay in my heart because of the time I've been here and because of the relationships. The honeymoon with Madrid is going to be until the last day of my life. \"I have read that he (Alonso) is leaving Bayer Leverkusen. He has done an incredible job and has the doors open because he has proven to be one of the best in the world.\" Real have lost all three previous games against Barcelona in this campaign, including the recentCopa del Rey final, and exited the Champions League at the quarter-final stage against Arsenal having won the competition last season. However, Ancelotti still regards this term as a decent campaign. \"It's been a good league and a good season,\" he said. \"You need continuity to be able to win it, or to be close explains very well what tomorrow's game is going to be. We both have a lot at stake. Barca will have more chances than us, but if we win it will still be all to play for.",

    "content": "ISLAMABAD/NEW DELHI, May 10 (Reuters) - Nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire on Saturday afterU.S. pressureand four days of fighting, but within hours explosions rang out in border cities and towns and India accused Pakistan of violating the pact. Artillery fire and attack drones were witnessed in Jammu and Kashmir, the centre of much of the fighting, while blasts from air-defence systems boomed in cities under blackout, similar to the previous evening, according to authorities, residents and Reuters witnesses. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told reporters that Pakistan had violated the understanding arrived at by the two countries earlier in the day, and that the Indian armed forces had been instructed to \"deal strongly\" with any repetition. \"We call upon Pakistan to take appropriate steps to address these violations and deal with the situation with seriousness and responsibility,\" Misri told a media briefing. In response, the foreign ministry of Pakistan said the country was committed to the ceasefire and blamed India for the violations. \"Our forces are handling the situation with responsibility and restraint,\" it said. The ministry also called on troops on the ground to exercise restraint and said that any issues in the implementation of the ceasefire should be addressed through communication at appropriate levels. Pakistan's military spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The fighting has been the worst between the old South Asian enemies in nearly three decades and threatened to erupt into a full-scale war in one of the world's most volatile and densely populated regions. There were briefly fears that nuclear arsenals might come into play as Pakistan's military said a top body overseeing its nuclear weapons would meet. But the defence minister said no such meeting was scheduled, hours after a night of heavy fighting in which the two countries targeted each other’s military bases and the combined civilian death toll rose to 66. \"Pakistan and India have agreed to a ceasefire with immediate effect,\" Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar posted on X. \"Pakistan has always strived for peace and security in the region, without compromising on its sovereignty and territorial integrity!\" Misri had earlier said the chiefs of the two countries' military operations had spoken to each other and agreed that all fighting would stop at 5 p.m. Indian time (1130 GMT). U.S. PresidentDonald Trumpposted: \"After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence.\" Dar told the broadcaster Geo News that military channels and hotlines between India and Pakistan had been activated, and three dozen countries had helped to facilitate the agreement. On Wednesday, India had attacked what it said was \"terrorist infrastructure\" in Pakistani Kashmir and Pakistan, two weeks after 26 people were killed in an attack on Hindu tourists in Indian Kashmir. Pakistan denied India's accusations that it was involved in the attack. Days of cross-border fire, shelling and drone and missile attacks followed. Despite the truce, two Indian government sources told Reuters that the punitive measures announced by India and reciprocated by Pakistan, such as trade suspension and visa cancellations, would remain in place for now. The sources also said the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, a critical water-sharing pact that India suspended after the Kashmir attack,would remain suspended. The Indian foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that he and Vice President JD Vance had engaged with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistan's Shehbaz Sharif, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Pakistan's army chief Asim Munir, and the two national security advisers over the course of 48 hours. In a post on X, Rubio commended Modi and Sharif on the agreement, which he said included not only an immediate ceasefire but also the start of talks on \"a broad set of issues at a neutral site.” News of the ceasefire was greeted with relief on both sides of the border and Pakistan's airport authority said its airspace had been fully reopened. But the subsequent violations sparked alarm in India. \"What the hell just happened to the ceasefire? Explosions heard across Srinagar!!!\", Omar Abdullah, chief minister of Indian Kashmir, posted on X. \"This is no ceasefire. The air defence units in the middle of Srinagar just opened up.\" India and Pakistan have been locked in adispute over Kashmirever since they were born at the end of British colonial rule in 1947. Hindu-majority India and Muslim Pakistan both rule part of Kashmir but claim it in full. They have gone to war three times, including twice over Kashmir, alongside numerous smalleroutbreaks of fighting. India blames Pakistan for an insurgency in its part of Kashmir that began in 1989 and has killed tens of thousands. It also blames Pakistani Islamist militant groups for attacks elsewhere in India. Pakistan rejects both charges. It says it provides only moral, political and diplomatic support to Kashmiri separatists.",

    "content": "VATICAN CITY, May 10 (Reuters) -Pope Leo XIVsignalled on Saturday he would continue with the vision and reforms of Pope Francis, telling the world's Catholic cardinals the late pontiff left a \"precious legacy\" that must carry on. In his first meeting with all the cardinals since hiselection as pontiffon May 8, Leo also asked the senior clerics to renew their commitment to major Church reforms enacted by the landmark Second Vatican Council in the 1960s. Leo said Francis,who died on April 21, broadly had a vision of opening the staid 1.4-billion-member Church to the modern world, had left an \"example of complete dedication to service.\" \"Let us take up this precious legacy and continue on the journey,\" the new pope told the cardinals. The pontiff also asked the clerics to \"renew together our complete commitment\" to the reforms enacted by the Council, which included celebrating the Mass in local languages rather than Latin and pursuing dialogue with other religions. He cited Francis' focus on \"courageous and trusting dialogue with the contemporary world in its various components and realities.\" Francis was pope for 12 years and often garnered criticism from conservative cardinals, who said he was watering down the Church's doctrine on issues such as inclusion of LGBT Catholics and women's leadership. Leo, the formerU.S. Cardinal Robert Prevost, wasa relative unknownon the global stage before his election as pontiff. He had spent most of his career as a missionary in Peru before serving as a senior Vatican official for the past two years. The new pope said on Saturday he had taken his papal name partly to honor Pope Leo XIII (1878-1903), who was known as an advocate for social justice and pushed for fair pay and treatment of workers during the industrial revolution. Leo XIV said the Church must now take the lead in facing newer threats to workers, such as artificial intelligence. He said AI posed \"new challenges for the defence of human dignity, justice and labour.\" Leo's speech came a few hours before he made a surprise visit later on Saturday to a Catholic shrine in Genazzano, about an hour's drive east of Rome. The pope was greeted to cheers from crowds gathered outside the Shrine of Our Lady of Good Counsel. He shook hands and offered blessings to a few people in the crowd before entering the shrine. Leo's two-hour meeting with the cardinals earlier on Saturday took a different format to that used by previous popes, who would typically offer a speech and expect the clerics only to listen. This time, Leo gave a prepared address and then opened the floor to any cardinal who wanted to make a comment -- allowing the clerics to voice their opinions and concerns about the main issues facing the global Church. \"He listened very carefully, but he knows he's going to have to make the decisions,\" Irish Cardinal Sean Brady told Reuters. \"But we're here to help him.\" Spanish Cardinal Aquilino Bocos Merino described the meeting as \"very cordial and communal.\" Leo greeted each of the cardinals individually as they left the meeting, which was held in the same small Vatican auditorium where the cardinals had been gathering in the days before the conclave to discuss who should be the next pope. Czech Cardinal Dominik Duka said one topic that came up was the situation of Catholics in communist China. The Vatican and China in 2018 signeda controversial dealon the appointment of bishops in the country, which gives Beijing some input into their selection. Conservatives have attacked the still-secret deal as a sell-out, but Duka told Reuters it was necessary to keep a dialogue open in places where the Church is oppressed, comparing it to dialogue between the Vatican and eastern European countries during the Cold War. German Cardinal Gerhard Mueller, who openly clashed with Francis on issues concerning Catholic moral teaching, told Reuters that Saturday's encounter was \"very good and harmonious.\" To be elected as pope during the May 7-8secret conclaveat the Sistine Chapel, Leo required a two-thirds majority of 89 of the 133 voting cardinals. Madagascar Cardinal Désiré Tsarahazana told reporters that Leo received more than 100 votes at the final ballot on the afternoon of May 8.",

    "content": "NEW DELHI/KARACHI, May 10 (Reuters) - A key water-sharing pact between India and Pakistan remains suspended, four government sources told Reuters, despite the countries reaching aceasefire agreementon Saturday after days ofdeadly fighting. TheIndus Waters Treaty, mediated by the World Bank in 1960, regulates the division of water from the Indus River and its tributaries between the South Asian nations. India pulled out of it last month after a deadly attack targeting Hindu tourists inKashmirthat it said was backed by Islamabad. Pakistan denied involvement in the violence and had said it waspreparinginternational legal action over the suspension of the treaty, which ensures water for 80% of its farms. \"Indus Waters Treaty was not really a part of (ceasefire) discussions,\" said a source from Pakistan's water ministry. An Indian government source also told Reuters there was \"no change in stand\" on the treaty. There was no immediate response from India's foreign ministry on the matter, or from officials at Pakistan's water ministry and the information minister. The pact was one of manytit-for-tat measurestaken by the South Asian nations after the Kashmir attack, including closure of land borders, suspension of trade, and a pause on issuance of almost all categories of visas to each other's citizens. Two sources from the Indian government told Reuters that all measures taken against Pakistan, including on trade and visas, would remain in place despite the pause in violence between the countries. India's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter. India and Pakistan had engaged in daily clashes since Wednesday when India struckmultiple locationsin Pakistan that it said were \"terrorist camps\". Fighting paused on Saturday evening with the countries reaching what Pakistan termed a \"ceasefire agreement\" and India called an agreement to \"stop all firing and military action.\"",

    "content": "GUANGZHOU, China, May 10 (Reuters) - Italy, Canada and Jamaica reached the mixed 4x100 metres relay final in the event's global debut while heavyweights the United States experienced mixed fortunes on a dramatic opening day at the World Athletics Relays on Saturday. Victory in 41.15 seconds in the first heat amid challenging conditions in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou following a spell of rain earned the Italians a place in the medal round to be held on Sunday. They will be joined by France, who finished second in 41.28 seconds, while pre-race favourites the U.S. saw their hopes of advancing fade when Jada Mowatt and Kendal Williams botched their baton exchange during the second changeover. Jamaica's mixed sprint quartet clocked 41.04 seconds to edge out Britain by a hundredth of a second in the next heat and they could deploy three-times Olympic champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce and former world champion Yohan Blake in the final. Canada crossed the line in a scorching 40.90 seconds to second-placed Australia's 41.15 seconds in the third heat to send out a warning to their rivals. The Americans made up for their error by easing into the mixed 4x400m final, thereby also sealing their spot in the event at the world championships tin Tokyo in September. The world record-holders will be joined in the Guangzhou final by Belgium, Australia, Ireland, Britain and South Africa as well as the two fastest non-automatic qualifiers Kenya and Poland. Spain went quickest in the women's 4x100m relay ahead of Jamaica and Belgium, clocking 42.18 seconds, while South Africa dominated the men's event with Akani Simbine anchoring his team to a joint world leading time of 37.84 seconds. Japan, who were assured of a place in the worlds as hosts, matched South Africa's effort in their heat to finish in front of Olympic champions Canada. The U.S. women's team shrugged off the increasingly damp conditions to top the timings in the 4x400m race while the men's quartet were third in their heat and will have to wait until Sunday to book their spot in the worlds. South Africa's men were quickest again in that event with a world leading time of exactly three minutes.",

The leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Poland -the so-called \"coalition of the willing\"- and Ukraine have met in Kyiv on Saturday. They agreed toan unconditional 30-day ceasefireon May 12 with the backing of U.S. President Donald Trump, threatening President Vladimir Putin with new \"massive\" sanctions if he failed to comply. Turkey's Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan joined the coalition of the willing call and emphasised Turkey's commitment to Ukraine's territorial integrity, the Turkish foreign ministry source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said. Fidan voiced Ankara's support for the efforts for the unconditional ceasefire and added that Turkey was ready to undertake the duty for observing the ceasefire in Ukraine if it is established, the source also said. NATO member Turkey has maintained cordial ties with both Kyiv and Moscow since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. It has voiced support for Ukraine's territorial integrity and provided it with military help, while opposing sanctions on Russia.

    "content": "MOSCOW, May 10 (Reuters) - The Kremlin accused European countries on Saturday of making contradictory and confrontational statements, after European leaders backed a U.S. plan for a 30-day ceasefire in Ukraine andthreatened Russiawith \"massive\" sanctions if it failed to comply. \"We hear many contradictory statements from Europe. They are generally confrontational in nature rather than aimed at trying to revive our relations. Nothing more,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. President Vladimir Putin \"has repeatedly said that he is ready for contacts with any leaders\", Peskov said. \"And he is open to interaction, to dialogue with any leaders to the extent that the leaders themselves are ready.\" Ukraine and European leaders agreed on Saturday that an unconditional 30-day ceasefire should start on Monday, with the backing of U.S. President Donald Trump. \"So all of us here together with the U.S. are calling Putin out. If he is serious about peace, then he has a chance to show it,\" British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said. Russia has long said that it is open to talks, accusing Kyiv of closing off that option by adopting a 2022 decree ruling out any negotiation with Putin. On Friday Peskov was quoted as saying that Russia supported the implementation of a 30-day ceasefire, but only with due consideration of \"a large number of nuances\". In separate remarks to ABC News that were aired on Saturday, the spokesman suggested that Western military assistance for Ukraine wouldhave to stopin order for a ceasefire to happen. \"Otherwise it will be an advantage for Ukraine,\" he said. Russia believes it has the advantage on the battlefield and says it is concerned that Ukraine could use a 30-day pause in the war to rest its forces, mobilise more men and get hold of more Western arms.",

    "content": "LONDON, May 10 (Reuters) - Chelsea completed an unbeaten season and set a points record in the Women's Super League with a 1-0 home win over Liverpool on Saturday and Arsenal held on for a 4-3 victory over Manchester United to finish second in the standings. Chelsea, who sealed theirsixth consecutive WSL titlelast month, were unable to break down Liverpool's defence until the 91st minute when Ashley Lawrence played in Aggie Beever-Jones and the England international produced an excellent right-foot shot from a tight angle. Chelsea, record eight-times champions, finished with 19 wins and three draws to earn 60 points - the highest total in a WSL season. They also became the first team to go unbeaten in a 22-match WSL campaign, though Arsenal (2012), Manchester City (2016) and Chelsea (2017-18) have achieved the feat in previous seasons with fewer games. \"We've just worked hard right until the end. Liverpool came with a game plan and defended really well,\" Chelsea midfielder Erin Cuthbert told Sky Sports ahead of the club's trophy celebrations at Stamford Bridge. \"We just had to keep at it, use the momentum, use the fans and Aggie got that goal at the end. I thought the girls run them down and made the job as a substitute really easily in the second half. Credit to everyone in the group.\" At the Emirates Stadium, Chloe Kelly scored in the second minute to give Arsenal an early lead but United's Ella Toone levelled in the 13th minute, before strikes from Mariona Caldentey, Frida Maanum and Kim Little put the hosts in the driving seat. Renee Slegers' team endured a nerve-wracking finish to the match as Elisabeth Terland and Maya Le Tissier scored but United could not complete the comeback. Arsenal, who face Barcelona in the Women's Champions League final this month, ended the season with 48 points, four ahead of third-placed United. \"Great way to start the game, it's great playing for this club and scoring at the Emirates is incredible,\" Arsenal goalscorer Kelly told the BBC. \"United are a great side and we were able to do our job in front of goal.\" Bottom club Crystal Palace, relegated from the WSL last month and set to be replaced by the London City Lionesses, were beaten 5-2 by fourth-placed Manchester City.",

    "title": "First white South Africans to arrive under US refugee plan as soon as next week",
    "content": "WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is aiming to bring the first group of white South Africans to the United States via its refugee program as soon as next week, three people familiar with the matter said, a divisive effort given that Trump has been blocking refugee admissions from the rest of the world. The Trump administration aims to fly the initial cohort of about 50 Afrikaners into Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia, two of the people said, requesting anonymity to share internal plans. The group would participate in a press conference at the airport and then board flights to their U.S. destinations, the sources said. The sources cautioned that their arrival had already been delayed a week and that the plans could change. As of Thursday afternoon, a charter plane intended to ferry them to the U.S. had not secured a landing permit, one source said. The U.S. State Department, which administers the resettlement of South Africans whom the Trump administration granted refugee status, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. NPR first reported the timing of the arrivals. Trump kicked off a wide-ranging immigration crackdown after taking office in January, including anindefinite suspensionof refugee resettlement. In a related executive order, the Republican president said the U.S. would only admit refugees who \"can fully and appropriately assimilate.\" Despite the broad refugee freeze, Trump in February called on the U.S. to prioritize resettling Afrikaners, descendants of mostly Dutch early settlers, saying they were \"victims of unjust racial discrimination.\" The assertion that minority white South Africans face discrimination from the Black majority has spread in far-right circles for years andbeen echoed, opens new tabby Trump's white South African-born ally Elon Musk. The average white household in South Africa owns 20 times the wealth of the average Black household, according to the Review of Political Economy, an international academic journal. In interviews with U.S. immigration officers, white South Africans seeking refugee status have highlighted troubles with land disputes, crime and perceived racism, Reutersreportedin April. The South African government has criticized the Trump effort, saying it fails to recognize the country's history of colonialism and apartheid. \"It is most regrettable that it appears that the resettlement of South Africans to the United States under the guise of being 'refugees' is entirely politically motivated and designed to question South Africa’s constitutional democracy,\" South Africa's foreign affairs ministry said in a statement on Friday. Stephen Miller, a top White House official and the architect of Trump's immigration agenda, defended the program while speaking to reporters, saying the situation \"fits the textbook definition\" of race-based persecution. While some Afrikaners have expressed interest in moving to politically conservative U.S. states, Democratic-leaning Minnesota has emerged as a popular choice, two of the sources told Reuters. Minnesota has a reputation as a welcoming state for refugees, including those from Somalia, Afghanistan, Ethiopia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Some also plan to head to Republican-leaning states, such as Idaho and Alabama, one of the sources said. The reason to charter a flight for the initial group of Afrikaners was not immediately clear. The charter plane would cost far more than commercial tickets, sources said.",

    "title": "Marc Marquez remains unbeaten in sprints with victory at French GP",
    "content": "LE MANS, France, May 10 (Reuters) - Ducati's Marc Marquez became the first MotoGP rider to win six straight sprints as the Spaniard maintained his perfect record in the shorter format at the French Grand Prix on Saturday to retake the championship lead from his brother Alex. Alex's Gresini Racing team mate and MotoGP rookie Fermin Aldeguer came third for his first sprint podium while polesitter Fabio Quartararo could only manage fourth place at his home Grand Prix. Alex came into the weekend with a one-point lead over Marc but after a sixth successive second-place finish in sprints, he is now two points behind his elder brother, who won by just over half a second. Quartararo had entertained the home crowd as he pushed hard at the start, but the Yamaha rider could not sustain that pace as he lost out to the dominant Ducati machines in an all-Spanish podium. \"Fabio, in the start, was super fast, he was pushing a lot and then I said, 'Okay, I cannot follow that pace on the first two laps',\" Marc said. \"But then I saw that he started to drop his pace a bit and then I felt better and better. In the last laps I was riding well, maybe the last lap I relaxed a bit too much, but I'm feeling good.\" FrenchmanQuartararo had taken polewhen he smashed the lap record and he briefly lost the lead off the line before regaining it when Marc Marquez went wide on turn one amid loud cheers from the stands. Ducati's Francesco Bagnaia, third in the riders' standings, lost a points-scoring opportunity when he crashed on lap two and is now 31 points behind his team mate. Up front, Marc's red Ducati was all over the rear tyre of Quartararo's blue Yamaha and the pair swapped positions on lap six before the Spaniard took the lead and opened up a gap. Within the space of two laps, Quartararo suddenly went from leading the sprint to falling to third when Alex lined up an overtake and shot past the Frenchman. French fans experienced a roller-coaster of emotions as Quartararo battled Aldeguer for the final podium spot before the Gresini rider found a way through and held on for third place. \"I feel incredible! It's a dream for me to be here with top riders... We have the speed but we need more experience,\" Aldeguer said.",

    "title": "Blue Jays' Addison Barger aims for encore vs. Mariners",
    "content": "May 10 - One might say Addison Barger got a triple-double. Barger hit three doubles and drove in two runs in a homecoming of sorts as the Toronto Blue Jays defeated the host Seattle Mariners 6-3 Friday night. The three-game series is scheduled to continue Saturday night. Barger also robbed the Mariners' Julio Rodriguez of an extra-base hit with a leaping catch of a 111-mph liner down the third-base line in the third inning to thwart a Seattle comeback from a 5-0 deficit. Barger was born in the Seattle suburb of Bellevue, Wash., and lived in the area until the age of 6, when his family moved to Florida. He idolized Mariners outfielder Ichiro Suzuki, who will be inducted into baseball's Hall of Fame this summer. Barger made his major-league debut last season, batting .197 over 69 games. But he showed flashes of potential. \"He swings the bat fast. He hits the ball hard. He can throw the ball hard,\" Blue Jays manager John Schneider said of Barger. \"There are a lot of things that should add up to success at this level. It's a matter of getting consistent reps and trusting his ability, really.\" Barger's doubles Friday were hit at 109.7, 113.4 and 116.5 mph. On defense, he retired Seattle's Dylan Moore with a 94.9 mph throw to first base. With Blue Jays second baseman Andres Gimenez going on the injured list Friday with a quad strain, Ernie Clement likely will get the majority of the playing time there, giving Barger a chance to be in the lineup at third. \"When he's playing regularly, that's when he's at his best,\" Schneider said. \"Addie needs to play. Hopefully he can get rolling here. He hits the ball as hard as anyone. He's as talented as anyone. This is a big shot for him.\" For his part, Barger wants to keep \"just chilling out\" and not putting too much pressure on himself. \"Just trying to convince yourself that you don't care that much,\" is the way he put it. The American League West-leading Mariners, who are going after a 10th consecutive series victory, appeared like they might rally from a five-run deficit for a second consecutive game. They pulled within 5-3 and loaded the bases with no outs in the eighth inning but failed to score. The Blue Jays made several sterling defensive plays, as center fielder Daulton Varsho robbed Seattle's Ben Williamson of a home run and shortstop Bo Bichette made a pair of leaping catches. \"Another outstanding effort by guys trying to come back\" Mariners manager Dan Wilson said. \"Hit a lot of balls on the screws right at somebody. We gave ourselves some opportunities and it didn't work out. Just got to come out (Saturday) and get 'em.\" Saturday's game is set to feature a pair of right-handers in Toronto's Bowden Francis (2-5, 5.66 ERA) and Seattle rookie Logan Evans (1-1, 7.20). Francis beat the Mariners 3-1 on April 18 in Toronto when he gave up one run on five hits over six innings, with five strikeouts. Evans will be making his third career start. He defeated the visiting Miami Marlins in his major-league debut on April 27 before getting tagged for six runs on 11 hits over five innings on Sunday in an 8-1 loss at Texas against the Rangers. --Field Level Media",

    "title": "Padres can't afford to let up against woeful Rockies",
    "content": "May 10 - The Colorado Rockies are 6-32 and owners of a seven-game losing streak, however they delivered a reminder to the San Diego Padres on Friday night that no lead is safe at Coors Field. \"You have to lock in and stay focused for all nine innings in this ballpark,\" San Diego designated hitter Gavin Sheets said after his team squandered most of a 13-2 lead in the eighth inning before walking away with a 13-9 decision. The Padres will attempt to make things a little easier on themselves Saturday night when they try for a series win against Colorado in Denver. San Diego reached season highs in runs and hits (16) in the series opener with the everyday lineup it had used since early April. The return of Jake Cronenworth from a fractured rib that cost him a month adds to a lineup top-heavy with star power. It means Sheets, who was batting second at times last month when four everyday players were on the injured list, can go back to hitting seventh. He drove in four runs on Friday night, while teammates Luis Arraez, Manny Machado and Jackson Merrill each rapped out three hits. With a fortified lineup behind him, right-hander Stephen Kolek (1-0, 0.00 ERA) will aim to produce a successful encore to his first big league start. Kolek fired 5 1/3 scoreless innings Sunday in a 4-0 win at Pittsburgh, allowing four hits and two walks while striking out four. \"It felt like my debut all over again,\" said Kolek, who was 3-0 last year as a rookie reliever. \"First time getting to do something I haven't done yet. I was having a lot of fun with it. My mindset was to try and put up as many zeros as I could from the very beginning.\" Kolek faced the Rockies three times out of the bullpen last year, allowing four runs on eight hits in 2 2/3 innings. Colorado will send right-hander Bradley Blalock (0-1, 8.03) to the mound. Blalock pitched 5 1/3 innings in a no-decision during a 6-3 loss at San Francisco on May 3, allowing three runs on two hits and two walks while striking out four. Blalock faced the Padres twice last year, giving up one run on six hits in 6 2/3 innings. The Rockies continued their nightmarish start to the season on Friday night, although they at least showed some pushback with their late rally. They scored five runs in the eighth and two more in the ninth, forcing San Diego to use closer Robert Suarez for the last two outs as he earned his 15th save. It came one day after a lopsided sweep of a doubleheader at the hands of the Detroit Tigers. That resulted in an emotional plea to their discouraged fans from veteran starting pitcher Kyle Freeland. \"Keep believing in us,\" he said. One bit of good news lately for Colorado has been the hitting of Jordan Beck. His eighth-inning homer Friday night was his sixth since April 24. --Field Level Media",

Conte's side have a three-point lead over Inter Milan, but even after a season which has exceeded all expectations at Napoli, there is constant media speculation over whether the coach will remain at the club next season. At a press conference before Sunday's home game with Genoa, when Conte was asked if the Napoli fans were asking him questions about his future, his response included the words of a famous Italian song. \"Trust me, the fans in this moment don't ask me this question,\" Conte said with a smile. \"The fans, apart from thanking me, they ask if we will win. And I answer that we will certainly try, as we are doing. This is their only question. \"The rest?

    "title": "Matthew Lugo likely to get longer look as Angels host Orioles",
    "content": "May 10 - The Los Angeles Angels likely will give another opportunity to a young player with considerable potential when they host the Baltimore Orioles on Saturday night in Anaheim, Calif. Outfielder Matthew Lugo was called up from Triple-A Salt Lake on Friday, his 24th birthday. He likely will make his first major league start on either Saturday or Sunday. Lugo made his major league debut in Friday's 4-1 loss to the Orioles, entering as a pinch runner in the eighth inning and manning center field in the ninth. The Angels are hoping Lugo realizes the promise that shortstop Zach Neto and catcher Logan O'Hoppe have shown so far after getting major league opportunities. The Angels acquired Lugo last season in a trade deadline deal with the Red Sox, sending reliever Luis Garcia to Boston. Lugo had a good spring training and nearly made the major league team before settling in at Salt Lake. Lugo got off to a slow start with the Bees but he's turned it on of late. He was hitting .212 with four homers, nine doubles, 18 RBIs and a .656 OPS in 35 games. \"I feel like when the season started, I was a little bit more conscious of swing decisions, and that made me be a little bit more late on the fastball,\" Lugo said. \"And now I'm just trying to be on time for the heater. And I've been seeing the ball very well and recognizing the pitches very well, and my swing just takes over after that.\" Right hander Jack Kochanowicz (1-5, 5.79 ERA) will make his eighth start of the season Saturday for Los Angeles. He is coming off a loss to the Detroit Tigers after allowing five runs and seven hits in five innings. He has yet to face the Orioles in his career. Right-hander Kyle Gibson (0-1, 14.09) will make his third start of the season for the Orioles, having joined the major league roster April 28 after spending the first month of the season in the minors. Gibson, who signed a one-year, $5.25 million contract with Baltimore, is 4-5 with a 5.83 ERA in 15 career starts against the Angels. At age 37 and with 13 years of major league experience, Gibson is being counted on to provide a veteran presence in the clubhouse. He left a good impression with the Orioles organization, playing in Baltimore in 2023 and winning 15 games. \"I'm thankful that these guys welcomed us a couple years ago and we were able to have so much fun, because they had an impact on me, too, you know? In a lot of different ways,\" Gibson said. \"Hopefully, I can still fit in with these guys. I know I'm two years older now, so hopefully, they don't hold that against me.\" Gibson's reputation not only impresses the team's younger players, but also a 41-year-old veteran like pitcher Charlie Morton. \"I've heard nothing but great things, and (Gibson) seems like a great dude. Phenomenal career. When I saw that (Gibson signed), I was excited,\" Morton said. \"I mean, guys were talking about Kyle to me when I first got here. They were like, 'Oh yeah, Kyle was this guy in the clubhouse. Gibby was one of the best guys I've been around. A great teammate.'\" --Field Level Media",

    "content": "May 10 - While a grind at times, Garrett Crochet's start to his Boston Red Sox tenure has been relatively solid. Meanwhile, budding Kansas City star Cole Ragans has been exceptional against the Red Sox during his career. With Ragans on the mound, the Royals will aim for an eighth consecutive victory on Saturday night when they face the visiting Red Sox. Kansas City's Michael Lorenzen tossed seven scoreless innings in Friday's series opener, while Boston rookie Hunter Dobbins did the same through six. Neither allowed a walk in a game in which the teams combined for just 14 hits, the first run wasn't scored until the 11th and the Royals won 2-1 in 12 innings. Runs could again be at a premium Saturday as Kansas City tries for its 17th win in 19 games. Crochet (3-2, 2.02 ERA), who despite having allowed five walks, yielded just three runs off two homers over 12 innings of his last two starts. He surrendered only a solo homer during a gritty five-inning effort in Sunday's 5-4 loss to Minnesota. \"I'm working on my mechanics, trying to just clean up command as a whole, velocity, as well,\" Crochet said. Crochet is 0-1 with a 1.86 ERA in seven appearances versus Kansas City. Crochet, then with the Chicago White Sox, allowed a two-run homer to Hunter Renfroe, two other hits and struck out five without a walk over five innings in a 5-3 loss to the Royals on April 7, 2024. Ragans (2-1, 3.79 ERA), meanwhile, was an AL Cy Young finalist last year, but has battled with inconsistency in 2025. However, the left-hander is 2-0 with a 1.35 ERA in three career starts against the Red Sox - over the last two seasons, with both wins coming in 2024. After giving up nine runs in seven innings from his previous two starts, then missing his next scheduled outing due to a groin issue, Ragans allowed three hits, two walks and struck out 11 over five innings of Monday's 3-0 win over the White Sox. \"I feel like I'm in a good spot,\" Ragans said. \"Really close to where I want to be. Still some tweaks to be made, but overall, felt like I'm in a good spot.\" Boston star Rafael Devers is 2-for-8 with a double against Ragans. Devers, who singled and drove in the game's first run with an RBI groundout Friday, is batting .365 with 12 RBIs in his last 13 games. On Thursday, Devers said he would not oblige a club request to move from designated hitter to first base, in the wake of Triston Casas' season-ending injury. Devers, who already switched to designated hitter from third base after Boston acquired Alex Bregman to begin the season, reportedly met with Red Sox owner John Henry, who flew to Kansas City on Friday. \"We felt it was important, based on the situation that unfolded (Thursday), to come out here and have an honest conversation about what we value as an organization and what we believe is important to the Boston Red Sox,\" Red Sox CEO Craig Breslow said. - Field Level Media",

    "title": "Mets' Tylor Megill looks to shut down potent Cubs offense",
    "content": "May 10 - The team with the best earned-run average in the National League will face the highest-scoring MLB team again when the New York Mets and visiting Chicago Cubs meet Saturday in the second game of their three-game series. The Mets won the opener Friday on the strength of four home runs and six innings of one-run pitching by Clay Holmes in the 7-2 game. The Mets lowered their team ERA to 2.82. New York will send Tylor Megill (3-2, 2.50 ERA) to the mound Saturday. The right-hander has 45 strikeouts in his seven starts and has only allowed two home runs. He hasn't had much luck against the Cubs in his career. In two starts, he is 0-2 with a 13.50 ERA, giving up 12 runs (10 earned) in 6 2/3 innings. \"He's a pro, he understands. He wants to be a big league pitcher,\" said Mets manager Carlos Mendoza on Megill, who bounced from the majors to the minors most of the first half of last season. \"He's got really good stuff. He should be a guy in this league. We are really counting on him. He needs to stay on the attack, keep getting ahead of hitters and limit damage.\" Limiting damage will be key Saturday as he takes on a Cubs team that has been doing serious damage all season. Chicago leads the majors with 225 runs and 349 hits and sits third in home runs with 57. Chicago even is tied for the most MLB stolen bases with 48. Kyle Tucker is doing what the Cubs expected of him when they acquired him in a trade with the Houston Astros in the offseason. He leads the team in batting average (.283), home runs (10), RBIs (32) and OBPs (.392). Tucker also has 10 stolen bases and has struck out only 22 times. The outfield is stellar for Chicago. Seiya Suzuki has nine home runs and 31 RBIs. Pete Crow-Armstrong has added nine home runs, 27 RBIs and 12 stolen bases. Even journeyman catcher Carson Kelly has joined the act with eight home runs and 23 RBIs. He never has had more than 18 home runs and 47 RBIs in a season, achieved in 2019 with the Arizona Diamondbacks. The Cubs, who are missing key starters Justin Steele and Shota Imanaga, are expected to start veteran Brad Keller (0-0, 3.78 ERA). Keller has never faced the Mets. Used as a reliever this season - he's thrown just 16 2/3 innings over 15 innings - he could be an opener and give way to top prospect Cade Horton, who would be making his major league debut. At Triple-A Iowa, the right-hander had a 2-1 record, 1.24 ERA and 33 strikeouts in 29 innings. \"It's been crazy, but I think it's a testament to all the hard work I put in this offseason and the strides I've made,\" Horton said Friday. \"Just maturing and really knowing it's my time.\" Keller, and those who follow him to the mound, will be asked to contain a Mets offense led by big free agent acquisition Juan Soto and Pete Alonso. Soto has eight home runs and 19 RBIs, including a pair of two home run games this month and a solo home run Friday. Alonso has benefited the most from Soto being in the lineup with nine home runs, 34 RBIs and a .324 average. Francisco Lindor has eight home runs and 25 RBIs. --Field Level Media",

    "content": "ZAPORIZHZHIA REGION, Ukraine, May 10 (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin has declared a three-day pause in fighting against Ukraine, but for bloodied Ukrainian soldiers limping into a field hospital, their wounds testified that the ceasefire was not being respected. One soldier, who gave his name as Stanislav, sat in the field hospital on Friday night cradling his left arm. It was wrapped in gauze bandage, and blood was soaking through. “There hasn’t been any ceasefire,\" said Stanislav, who did not give his full name in line with Ukrainian military protocol. \"Shelling has continued just as before, drones are flying just like before, the same with explosives being dropped. Nothing has changed at all.\" \"Look, we were driving today, there were mortars all the way. Advance parties moved forward, they tried to attack.\" Putin announced the three-day ceasefire to coincide with a May 9 military parade on Moscow's Red Square where he hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping and other leaders in commemoration of the end of World War Two. The ceasefire is due to end at midnight (2100 GMT) on Saturday. Ukraine did not sign up for the ceasefire, calling it a ruse by Putin. Each side has accused the other of carrying on fighting regardless, though there has been a pause in long-range attacks on each other's capitals. Reuters was given access to the field hospital, in the Zaporizhzhia region of southern Ukraine that is partially controlled by Russian forces, on condition the news agency did not disclose the exact location. Medics examined soldiers as they came in and replaced the dressings that had been hurriedly put on their wounds out in the field. The more serious cases were placed on a gurney while medics bandaged them, checked their vital signs, and cleaned dried blood and mud off their skin. One of the medics, who gave his name as Oleh, said it was a regular night's work, even with the Russian-declared ceasefire. “The same as usual, we got used to it. They will never change,\" he said of the Russian forces. \"Just the opposite, we know that if they declare some sort of ceasefire it will be exactly the opposite. No question about that. They keep shooting.\"",

    "content": "BERLIN, May 10 (Reuters) - The new German foreign minister, Johann Wadephul, departed for Israel on Saturday for a Middle East trip in which \"critical discussions\" are expected, he said when leaving Berlin. \"In both of our democracies, critical discussions about the policies of one's own government and friendly nations are part of this,\" Wadephul said on Saturday. Wadephul condemned the Hamas' attacks \"in the strongest terms\" and called for the liberation of all hostages.

Israel's campaign has killed more than 52,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, according to Hamas-run health authorities. \"I will ask about the strategic objective of the fighting, which has intensified again since March,\" Wadephul said. According to a Foreign Office spokesperson, Wadephul will meet Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Wadephul will also visit the Yad Vashem memorial and talk to the relatives of hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.

    "title": "Corbin Burnes, D-backs look to keep Dodgers under wraps",
    "content": "May 10 - Arizona Diamondbacks right-hander Corbin Burnes will be back on the mound Saturday. He cannot wait. Last week, Burnes, missed his first turn through the rotation since a COVID-forced injured list stint while with Milwaukee in 2021. He will return to face Los Angeles Dodgers right-hander Dustin May on Saturday in the third contest of a four-game series between the National League West rivals in Phoenix. The D-backs could use all the length they can get out of Burnes after using six pitchers in a 14-11 loss to the Dodgers on Friday. Shohei Ohtani's three-run homer capped a six-run ninth inning in a game in which the Dodgers led 8-3 before five homers allowed the Diamondbacks to seize an 11-8 advantage. \"Between him and Barry Bonds, the two best players I've ever seen,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said about Ohtani. \"I've never seen anything like what he (Ohtani) does in the clutch.\" Each team has one victory in this series. The D-backs prevailed on Thursday, 5-3. Burnes (1-1, 3.58 ERA) missed Monday's contest because of shoulder inflammation that had bothered him in his previous three outings. He took a cortisone shot May 2, which prevented him from taking his regular turn. \"Did it (stink) I didn't get to pitch? Yes,\" he said about missing the start. \"But there is more value to the team in skipping a start and making sure I'm healthy for the rest of the year than continuing to push through it and have something pop up where we miss two or three months. There is always that bigger picture. \"Could I have gone and pitched? Probably. Would I have been at 80-85 percent effectiveness? Probably. And who knows when it would have subsided. This was just the right time to take a step back, take that time, avoid anything from getting more serious and having to miss three months of a season versus one start.\" May (1-2, 4.36) understands the frustration that injuries can bring. May returned to the Dodgers' rotation this season after missing all of 2024 and parts of the previous three seasons because of Tommy John surgery, a flexor tendon repair and a torn esophagus. \"There are some good things in there,\" Roberts said after May's last outing, a no-decision in which he gave up four runs in 5 2/3 innings. The Dodgers have faced a length issue most of the season -- their starters have thrown 176 innings, the fewest in the majors. Roki Sasaki went four innings before being removed from his start Friday. \"It's tough,\" Roberts said. \"They've got to put us in position to run them deeper. That's just the way it goes.\" Burnes is looking for his first home victory. He gave up only seven earned runs in his previous four starts. Burnes is 2-3 with a 5.40 ERA in eight appearances (six starts) against the Dodgers. Ohtani is 3-for-6 with a homer versus Burnes, including hitting a leadoff homer off him in their lone meeting last season. May is 1-1 with a 4.42 ERA against the D-backs in five appearances (four starts). --Field Level Media",

    "content": "BARCELONA, May 10 (Reuters) - Barcelona's players have discussed last week's Champions League elimination and are ready to put their disappointment behind them as they prepare to face LaLiga title rivals Real Madrid, manager Hansi Flick said on Saturday. Barca, who suffered a4-3 Champions League semi-final defeatby Inter Milan on Tuesday, lead the Spanish top-flight by four points over second-placed Real. With four matches left in the season, a home win on Sunday would move Flick's side one victory away from their 28th Spanish league title. \"We're doing well. After the defeat in Milan, everyone knows it's not easy... but we're doing things right. We've talked about what we want to do in these two weeks,\" Flick told reporters. \"There are four more games to go. El Clasico is important, we have to show how well we can play. We have to show confidence. The players are doing very well... We've been talking about what they are thinking, what they are feeling. \"We had to talk about it as a group. Everyone knows that in a Clasico you have to give 100%. You have to be active, intense, dominant. Real Madrid is a very good team, and we need the fans.\" Barcelona have conceded 10 goals in their last four games across all competitions, leading to questions over their solidity and the team's use of a high line when defending. Flick, however, is content with his back line. \"When we started, I was clear about the philosophy... There have been games, especially at the beginning, where we saw doubts, but the team has adapted well,\" he said. \"They have also been improving and are happy with the style and how we want to play. When you see the quality of the players you are happy.\" Flick also singled out defender Inigo Martinez for praise. \"He likes to play deeper, and it's unbelievable to see how he's adapted,\" the German said. \"He's a leader and focuses on winning every game. He works hard in every training session. He shares his positive feelings with his teammates and he is a fighter. A great leader.\" Flick said striker Robert Lewandowski, returning from a hamstring injury, and full back Alejandro Balde would not start against Real. \"Gerard Martin and the rest of the players are doing very well,\" Flick said. \"After this match, we have three more games left. Maybe they (Lewandowski and Balde) will get minutes in the second half, I think Balde is ready for that.\"",

    "title": "Logan Webb, Giants look to slow down streaking Twins",
    "content": "May 10 - Right-hander Logan Webb's 152nd career major-league start will be his first against Minnesota on Saturday when the San Francisco Giants seek to halt the Twins' seven-game home winning streak. Minnesota rode a pitching gem by Chris Paddack to its sixth straight win overall, a 3-1 victory on Friday in the opener of the three-game series in Minneapolis. The Giants mustered just three hits in the setback. San Francisco will hope for a similar effort from its ace, Webb (4-2, 2.61 ERA), who will be pitching for the fourth time this season in the game following a loss. The Giants have won two of those three contests. Webb is scheduled to be opposed by Twins right-hander Joe Ryan (2-2, 2.93), a fellow 28-year-old who played his high school ball in the San Francisco Bay Area while Webb was starring in the Sacramento suburb of Rocklin. Webb, a career-long Giant who skipped college after having been the team's fourth-round pick in 2014, has faced all but three of the 30 major league teams in his career. Other than the Giants and Twins, he has yet to pitch against the Cleveland Guardians. The 2024 All-Star has alternated wins and losses in his last five outings, most recently having thrown seven innings of one-run ball in a 9-3 home triumph over the Colorado Rockies on Sunday. In Ryan, Webb will be up against a rival of sorts. While Webb was progressing through the Giants' system, Ryan was attending Stanislaus State in the California central valley, studying the form of one of his idols. \"Anything that Webb's throwing,\" Ryan said of what he was hoping to absorb, even as both have become successful major-leaguers. \"I've been sitting on the iPad watching his outings. He just looks insane right now. That sinker-sweeper combo, the velo on both -- and how smooth the mechanics are ...\" Ryan has been Webb-like in his last two starts, limiting the Los Angeles Angels and Boston Red Sox to a total of one run and eight hits over 13 innings with 19 strikeouts. The fifth-year major-leaguer will be facing the Giants for the fourth time, having gone 2-1 with a 3.31 ERA in the previous starts. If there was a positive for the Giants in the series-opening defeat, it was that the infield played its second straight error-free game. A misplay by left fielder Heliot Ramos on Byron Buxton's sixth-inning single, which allowed Minnesota's final run to score, was San Francisco's only miscue in the fast-moving affair. So far, shortstop Willy Adames' vow to turn things around after committing seven errors in his first 36 games has come to fruition. \"You get into bad habits and stuff. You just get unlucky sometimes,\" he said of a rut both he and third baseman Matt Chapman had gotten into. \"I feel like for me and Chappy, it hasn't been the best. We'll be good. We're going to be alright. We're just going to continue to work.\" --Field Level Media",

    "content": "May 10 - Astros right-hander Hunter Brown fell just one out shy of logging at least six innings for the eighth time this season in a 3-0 win Friday night over the Cincinnati Reds. His ability to eat up innings has allowed Houston manager Joe Espada to deploy his bullpen in the most effective means possible. And the relief corps has been stalwart for Espada and the Astros, who enter play Saturday with the second-best bullpen ERA (2.73) in the American League as they host the Reds in the second game of a three-game series. Right-hander Lance McCullers Jr. (0-0, 0.00 ERA) will have the bullpen as his back-up when he makes his second start this season for the Astros on Saturday. He made his first appearance since Game 3 of the 2022 World Series on Sunday against the Chicago White Sox and allowed three hits and three walks and recorded four strikeouts over 3 2/3 scoreless innings. He tossed 87 pitches and did not factor into the decision of the Astros' 5-4 loss. \"I think he pitched well for 3 2/3, lot of foul balls, lot of high-stress moments there, but I think he pitched out of them, so he'll get ready for the next one, but I thought he threw the ball well,\" Espada said. McCullers was happy to have that first game back over. \"You know, to start from where I've come from over the last couple years, especially where I was early this offseason, I would lie to you guys if I didn't say I was pretty proud of myself,\" McCullers told reporters on Sunday. \"But I understand that at the same time, I expect more out of myself. I know I'll be better as the year and the starts progress.\" McCullers has faced the Reds once previously. He allowed two runs on eight hits and three walks with six strikeouts over 6 2/3 innings but did not factor into the decision of a 4-2 home loss on June 17, 2016. Right-hander Brady Singer (4-2, 3.66) has the starting assignment for the Reds. He suffered a second consecutive loss on Monday, this one to the Atlanta Braves, after allowing four runs on seven hits and two walks with two strikeouts over six innings in a 4-0 setback. Singer is 1-2 with a 4.23 ERA over five career starts against the Astros. The Reds made six transactions before Friday's game, only to make another during the contest with the potential for yet another transaction set for Saturday. The Reds announced the acquisition of utilityman Connor Joe from the San Diego Padres during the game in exchange for minor league right-hander Andrew Moore and cash considerations. In a corresponding move, the Reds transferred Tyler Callihan (broken left forearm) to the 60-day injured list. Additionally, the Reds scratched right fielder Jake Fraley after a pregame test of his sore left calf did not yield favorable results. \"We talked to Jake and we were like, 'We appreciate you're trying to push through this,'\" Reds manager Terry Francona said. \"What are the chances he plays (Friday) and doesn't feel good (Saturday)? So if we IL him (Saturday), we can push it back three days and he can be available next Friday, I believe is the right day, and hopefully feel better. That's the idea.\" --Field Level Media",

    "content": "May 10 - Tim Elko's professional journey began in 2022, when the Chicago White Sox selected the first baseman in the 10th round of the draft out of Mississippi. Elko reportedly is set to make his major league debut on Saturday when the White Sox continue a three-game series against the visiting Miami Marlins. Elko will be recalled from Triple-A Charlotte, where he was batting .348 with 10 home runs in 31 games. He likely will share playing time at first base with Andrew Vaughn, who hit a solo homer in Chicago's 6-2 win over Miami on Friday. The White Sox snapped a four-game losing streak with the victory, while Miami lost for the 10th time in its last 12 games. Chicago is hoping the 26-year-old Elko can provide a spark. Known among his teammates as \"the Captain,\" Elko has a .293 batting average with 61 homers in 325 minor-league games. \"He's obviously been swinging very well and we're excited to add him to the lineup,\" White Sox manager Will Venable said. Saturday's pitching matchup features a pair of right-handers as Miami's Edward Cabrera (0-1, 6.29 ERA) takes on Chicago's Shane Smith (1-2, 2.41). Cabrera, 27, received a no-decision after giving up two runs over a season-high-tying 5 2/3 innings against the Athletics last Sunday. \"This was a really good version of Eddie,\" Miami manager Clayton McCullough said. \"He was in control. He really spun the ball well, and he kept the count in his favor for the most part. That allowed him to use all his weapons. It was a start he can certainly build upon.\" Cabrera is set to make his second career start against the White Sox. He gave up two runs over 3 2/3 innings in a no-decision versus Chicago on July 7, 2024. The Marlins have yet to face Smith, who yielded two runs over five-plus innings in a 3-0 loss to the Kansas City Royals last Monday. The 25-year-old rookie has pitched at least five innings and allowed two earned runs or fewer in six of his first seven career starts. \"He finds different ways to attack hitters and I think you see it pretty quickly on a day where it's the changeup that he really likes and feels good about -- or the slider, or when he mixes in the curveball,\" Venable said. \"Just his adaptability from start to start, from inning to inning, I think is impressive for such a young guy.\" Miami is looking to bounce back after going 1-for-15 with runners in scoring position and leaving 11 runners on base in Friday's loss. Catcher Liam Hicks hit a leadoff shot in the seventh inning for his third homer this season and second in as many games. The Marlins' most consistent hitter has been left fielder Kyle Stowers, who is hitting .295 with six homers and a team-high 25 RBIs in 35 games. \"He's just someone that is always looking for ways in which I need to improve and ways I need to continue to adjust, and that's a sign of a good young player that is open to understanding that you're always going to have to adapt at some point,\" McCullough said. --Field Level Media",

    "content": "ISLAMABAD/NEW DELHI, May 10 (Reuters) - Nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire on Saturday afterU.S. pressureand four days of fighting, but within hours explosions rang out in border cities and towns and India accused Pakistan of violating the pact. Artillery fire and attack drones were witnessed in Jammu and Kashmir, the centre of much of the fighting, while blasts from air-defence systems boomed in cities under blackout, similar to the previous evening, according to authorities, residents and Reuters witnesses. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told reporters that Pakistan had violated the understanding arrived at by the two countries earlier in the day, and that the Indian armed forces had been instructed to \"deal strongly\" with any repetition. \"We call upon Pakistan to take appropriate steps to address these violations and deal with the situation with seriousness and responsibility,\" Misri told a media briefing. In response, the foreign ministry of Pakistan said the country was committed to the ceasefire and blamed India for the violations. \"Our forces are handling the situation with responsibility and restraint,\" it said. The ministry also called on troops on the ground to exercise restraint and said that any issues in the implementation of the ceasefire should be addressed through communication at appropriate levels. Pakistan's military spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The fighting has been the worst between the old South Asian enemies in nearly three decades and threatened to erupt into a full-scale war in one of the world's most volatile and densely populated regions. There were briefly fears that nuclear arsenals might come into play as Pakistan's military said a top body overseeing its nuclear weapons would meet. But the defence minister said no such meeting was scheduled, hours after a night of heavy fighting in which the two countries targeted each other’s military bases and the combined civilian death toll rose to 66. \"Pakistan and India have agreed to a ceasefire with immediate effect,\" Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar posted on X. \"Pakistan has always strived for peace and security in the region, without compromising on its sovereignty and territorial integrity!\" Misri had earlier said the chiefs of the two countries' military operations had spoken to each other and agreed that all fighting would stop at 5 p.m. Indian time (1130 GMT). U.S. PresidentDonald Trumpposted: \"After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence.\" Dar told the broadcaster Geo News that military channels and hotlines between India and Pakistan had been activated, and three dozen countries had helped to facilitate the agreement. On Wednesday, India had attacked what it said was \"terrorist infrastructure\" in Pakistani Kashmir and Pakistan, two weeks after 26 people were killed in an attack on Hindu tourists in Indian Kashmir. Pakistan denied India's accusations that it was involved in the attack. Days of cross-border fire, shelling and drone and missile attacks followed. Despite the truce, two Indian government sources told Reuters that the punitive measures announced by India and reciprocated by Pakistan, such as trade suspension and visa cancellations, would remain in place for now. The sources also said the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, a critical water-sharing pact that India suspended after the Kashmir attack,would remain suspended. The Indian foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that he and Vice President JD Vance had engaged with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistan's Shehbaz Sharif, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Pakistan's army chief Asim Munir, and the two national security advisers over the course of 48 hours. In a post on X, Rubio commended Modi and Sharif on the agreement, which he said included not only an immediate ceasefire but also the start of talks on \"a broad set of issues at a neutral site.” News of the ceasefire was greeted with relief on both sides of the border and Pakistan's airport authority said its airspace had been fully reopened. But the subsequent violations sparked alarm in India. \"What the hell just happened to the ceasefire? Explosions heard across Srinagar!!!\", Omar Abdullah, chief minister of Indian Kashmir, posted on X. \"This is no ceasefire. The air defence units in the middle of Srinagar just opened up.\" India and Pakistan have been locked in adispute over Kashmirever since they were born at the end of British colonial rule in 1947. Hindu-majority India and Muslim Pakistan both rule part of Kashmir but claim it in full. They have gone to war three times, including twice over Kashmir, alongside numerous smalleroutbreaks of fighting. India blames Pakistan for an insurgency in its part of Kashmir that began in 1989 and has killed tens of thousands. It also blames Pakistani Islamist militant groups for attacks elsewhere in India. Pakistan rejects both charges. It says it provides only moral, political and diplomatic support to Kashmiri separatists.",

    "content": "PALERMO, Italy, May 10 (Reuters) - Work to recover the late British tech tycoonMike Lynch's sunkensuperyachtoff the coast of northern Sicily has been paused following the death of a diver involved in the operations, the company leading the effort said on Saturday. The 56-metre-long (184-foot) Bayesian was moored off the small port of Porticello, near Palermo, in August last year when it was likely hit by a downburst, a very strong downward wind, killing seven people, including Lynch and his daughter Hannah. \"This pause in activity is necessary for the investigations to be completed and to allow all salvage and associated teams to mourn the tragic loss of a highly respected salvage diver during yesterday's underwater work,\" TMC Marine said in a statement. The accident happened on Friday while the diver was underwater in Porticello, police said, adding that the precise cause of death was still unknown. Italian news agencies reported that the diver was a 39-year-old Dutch national who worked for the Dutch specialist salvage company Hebo Maritiemservice. The AGI news agency said the man was hit by a piece of metal as divers were cutting the boom - the horizontal pole attached to the vertical mast of the ship - from the wreck of the Bayesian. The attempt to lift the yacht off the seabed, as requested by Italian prosecutors, had been scheduled to take placelater this monthand is supposed to help shed light on how a supposedly unsinkable vessel disappeared into the sea. It was unclear how long the temporary suspension announced on Saturday would last. \"The salvage team is providing full cooperation to the authorities in their investigations (into the death of the diver)\", Marcus Cave, Head of Naval Architecture and a Director of TMC Marine, said. \"While there is considerable interest in this project, we would ask the media to be considerate of the entire project team and allow sufficient time for the investigations to run their course, and for those affected to reflect and mourn at this terribly sad time,\" he added.",

    "title": "Rangers' Jacob deGrom continues road back vs. Tigers",
    "content": "May 10 - The strikeouts aren't quite there yet but Jacob deGrom is starting to resemble the $185 million ace who the Texas Rangers invested in before the 2023 season. The right-hander hasn't allowed more than two runs in any of his past four starts. He'll make his eighth start of the season on Saturday in the middle game of a three-game series against the Tigers in Detroit. That itself is nearing a milestone; deGrom started only nine games combined the past two seasons because of injury. In deGrom's final start of April, he held the Athletics scoreless for six innings in a 15-2 win. He pitched five innings against Seattle on Sunday, limiting the Mariners to one run and three hits and got the decision in the 8-1 victory. \"It was just another great start, maybe not quite as sharp, but he gave up one run in five innings,\" manager Bruce Bochy said. \"He worked a little harder today, but he's just so good. He's obviously a tremendous pitcher, with his command and everything and the poise. It's good to see him healthy and just throwing the ball the way he is.\" A two-time National League Cy Young Award winner, deGrom (2-1, 2.61 ERA) hasn't made it more than 15 starts since the 2019 season, when he took the mound 32 times for the New York Mets. In his most dominant seasons, he posted double-digit strikeout-to-walk ratios. His ratio thus far is 4.0 with 36 strikeouts in 38 innings. \"He's got his stuff no matter what the day is, so even when he feels a little off, his stuff's still going to be there,\" catcher Jonah Heim said. \"It's pretty electric, and like I said before, when he's throwing all his pitches for strikes and we can use them whenever we want, it's going to be a pretty good day for us.\" DeGrom gave up one run in 6 2/3 innings in his lone career start against the Tigers in 2016. Jack Flaherty (1-4, 3.79 ERA) will start for Detroit. The Tigers have lost each of the past five games Flaherty has started, mainly due to lack of run support. They have only scored a total of 10 runs in those outings. Getting deep into the game has also been an issue for Flaherty, who hasn't gone more than six innings in a start this season. Opponents are batting .211 in his first time through the order and .169 the second time around. That average jumps to .393 the third time, through. His most recent outing is a case in point. Flaherty held the Los Angeles Angels to one run in five innings but gave up four more in the sixth. \"That third time through, I don't know,\" Flaherty said. \"I am searching there for that back half, to carry the stuff over from the first handful of innings to the back half of the game.\" Opponents are 11 for 21 and have scored eight runs off Flaherty in the sixth inning. Manager A.J. Hinch said he believes Flaherty will soon get past those issues. \"He's going to be good in those situations when he executes because Jack is always good when he executes,\" Hinch said. Flaherty is 1-0 with a 1.06 ERA in three career starts against the Rangers. The Tigers have won five straight and eight of their past nine. They captured the series opener, 2-1, on Friday as ace Tarik Skubal struck out 12 in seven innings. Texas has lost 12 of its past 16 games. --Field Level Media",

    "title": "WRAPUP1 Rugby-Chiefs move clear at Super Rugby summit with comeback win over Crusaders",
    "content": "May 10 (Reuters) - Waikato Chiefs secured a 35-19 win over the Canterbury Crusaders on Saturday to open up a two-point lead at the top of the Super Rugby Pacific standings as they overturned a 16-point deficit to secure victory in Christchurch on Saturday. Fullback Damian McKenzie scored 20 points, including a try to lead the Chiefs to their ninth win of the campaign in the top-of-the-table clash. \"There was some good footie played against a quality side,\" said Chiefs captain Luke Jacobson. \"That first half the Crusaders came out and they threw plenty of shots and they got some good points on the board from it, but I didn't feel like we were too far off.\" Tries from Tom Christie, Scott Barrett and Antonio Shalfon put the Crusaders into a 19-3 lead by the 38th minute, but the Chiefs ate away at that advantage to take the win. Winger Emoni Narawa's try late in the first half gave the hosts a glimmer of hope before McKenzie revitalised his team, crossing the line to drag the Chiefs to within two points. Leroy Carter sprinted down the left from deep inside his own half to score a fine individual effort and give the Chiefs the lead for the first time before Wallace Sititi put the result beyond doubt seven minutes from time. The ACT Brumbies moved up to second place with a 33-14 bonus-point victory over the Western Force in Perth. The win may have come at a considerable cost, however, as flyhalf Noah Lolesio was carried off in the first half with what looked like a neck injury. It will still be a concern for Australia coach Joe Schmidt with the British and Irish Lions tour less than two months away. Len Ikitau, Corey Toole, Tom Hooper, Ollie Sapsford and Liam Bowron crossed for tries for the visitors. The Force scored first through Kane Koteka and Mac Grealy added a second for the ninth-placed side whose playoff hopes are fading. The New South Wales Waratahs opened up a 14-point lead early in the first half but could not keep up their momentum and lost 28-21 to the Queensland Reds as rain fell at Sydney Football Stadium. Henry O'Donnell and Jake Gordon scored tries in the first 20 minutes, but Tate McDermott and Richie Asiata crossed the line to level the scores at halftime. Replacement prop Taniela Tupou drove over from close range to put the home side back in front but, with Tupou off the field due to a yellow card, hooker Josh Nasser and winger Lachie Anderson scored the tries that took the visitors to victory. The Reds stayed fourth as the Waratahs continued to slide down the standings, with Dan McKellar's team in eighth place with three rounds remaining. Auckland Blues continued their resurgence with a comfortable 34-5 win over the Fijian Drua to move up to sixth with tries from Marcel Renata, Taufa Funaki, Josh Fusitu'a, Angus Ta'avao and Cole Forbes securing a bonus-point victory in Suva. \"We know that it's finals time soon and we've got to make our way there somehow, and for us it's week by week,\" Blues second row Patrick Tuipulotu said.",

    "title": "Guardians look to flex muscles again in rematch vs. Phillies",
    "content": "May 10 - The Cleveland Guardians are known for playing small ball, advancing runners one base at a time through aggressive baserunning. That style was so successful when they advanced to the 2024 American League Championship Series, the team's marketing department made it the theme of this season as Guards Ball. Cleveland, however, used the long ball en route to posting a 6-0 victory over the visiting Philadelphia Phillies on Friday. The teams meet again Saturday night in the second contest of the three-game series. Angel Martinez hit a two-run homer and Jose Ramirez and Kyle Manzardo had solo shots, giving the Guardians a 20-1 record when they go deep at least three times in a game since Stephen Vogt took over as manager in 2024. \"The way I see it is more like we go really aggressive from the get-go,\" Martinez said through an interpreter. \"It's not necessarily that we smell blood, it's just a consequence of everything we do previously. We're able to put it all together like that.\" Despite hitting at the bottom of the order, Martinez has been a significant contributor since his recall from Triple-A Columbus on April 9. The 23-year-old center fielder is batting .325 with one homer and 11 RBIs in 25 games, making 20 starts. Cleveland has won 20 of its last 29 games, including three straight after Gavin Williams and three relievers combined on a six-hitter against Philadelphia. \"If you're hitting first or hitting last for us, it's the same mindset to try to help and do the best for the team,\" Martinez said. \"You have to contribute and help the other guys.\" Guardians ace Tanner Bibee (3-2, 4.26 ERA) will get the start against Phillies left-hander Ranger Suarez (0-0, 17.18) on Saturday. Bibee has gone three starts without a loss, going 2-0 with a 2.50 ERA over 18 innings. The right-hander won his lone game against the Phillies, tossing seven scoreless innings on July 22, 2023. Suarez made his season debut May 4 against the Arizona Diamondbacks, allowing seven runs in 3 2/3 innings. He spent the first five weeks of the season on the injured list with low back stiffness, and is 0-1 with a 6.00 ERA in two career outings against Cleveland. The Phillies should be much fresher against Bibee than they were against Williams, given their late arrival in Northeast Ohio following a 10-inning win Thursday night in Tampa. They overcame a four-run deficit to complete a series sweep of the Rays with a 7-6 victory on Thursday. The Phillies went 0-for-8 with runners in scoring position and had their six-game homer stretch end on Friday. Trea Turner and Nick Castellanos each had two hits. \"Tough travel last night,\" said Turner, who has a .417 average during his eight-game hitting streak. \"For sure, (Williams) made some good pitches and we swung out of the zone. We had our chances, but didn't get the job done.\" Philadelphia has won nine of its last 12 games overall. Designated hitter Kyle Schwarber is riding a 44-game on-base streak that is tied for the fifth longest in franchise history. He extended the streak with a sixth-inning walk off Tim Herrin. \"It's unfortunate we couldn't shove a couple runs across,\" Phillies manager Rob Thomson said. \"We'll get some rest and come back (on Saturday).\" --Field Level Media",

    "content": "MOSCOW, May 10 (Reuters) - Russia said on Saturday that fighting had been taking place in four regions of Ukraine despite this week's unilateral ceasefire by Moscow, saying its troops had been forced to respond to Ukrainian attacks. Ukraine says Russia has continued to attack it and has called the ceasefire a farce. It did not join the truce but is calling instead for a 30-day ceasefire that U.S. President Donald Trump is urging thewarring sidesto agree. Reuters could not verify battlefield accounts by either side. The 72-hour ceasefire, declared by President Vladimir Putin to mark the 80th anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany, expires at midnight (2100 GMT) on Saturday. In a statement, the Russian defence ministry said its forces were sticking to the ceasefire - which Ukraine denies - and remaining at previously occupied lines, but that they were retaliating against \"violations\" by Ukraine. It alleged that Kyiv's forces had mounted attacks in the Sumy, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions of Ukraine and near 12 different settlements in Donetsk region, which it said Russian troops had repelled. A wounded Ukrainian soldier at a field hospital in Zaporizhzhia region told Reuters on Friday night that \"there hasn't been any ceasefire\" andnothing had changed. \"Shelling has continued just as before, drones are flying just like before,\" he said. The Russian statement also said that Ukraine had tried four times to break across the border into Russia's Kursk and Belgorod regions, but did not specify when the alleged attempted incursions had taken place.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON, May 10 (Reuters) - The U.S. government said it offered assistance to make India and Pakistan start \"constructive talks\" while the Group of Seven (G7) major countries also urged the Asian neighbors to engage in direct dialogue amidheightened hostilities. World powers have raised the alarm over thelatest escalationin the decades-oldIndia-Pakistan rivalry. India hit Pakistan with air strikes and missiles on Wednesday and since then the nuclear-armed countries have been clashing daily while launching strikes against each other's military installations on Saturday. Dozens havebeen killed. The U.S., especially Secretary of State Marco Rubio, has held regular talks with both India and Pakistan since late April and urged them to de-escalate. The U.S. State Department late on Friday and early Saturday released three statements on Rubio's calls with Pakistan Army Chief Asim Munir, and the foreign ministers of India and Pakistan. It said Rubio urged them to \"re-establish direct communication to avoid miscalculation\" while offering U.S. assistance \"in starting constructive talks\" to avoid future conflicts. Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based South Asia analyst and writer for the Foreign Policy magazine, said Rubio's decision to call the army chief directly was \"the most consequential move the U.S. has made\" since the start of the crisis: \"If you want to talk to the Pakistanis about de-escalation, you need to talk to General Munir.\" President Donald Trump said earlier this week the rising tensionswere a shame. U.S. Vice PresidentJD Vancesaid a war would be \"none of our business.\" In recent years, India has been seen as a partner by Western powers to counter China's rising influence. Pakistan is a U.S. ally although its importance has diminished since Washington's 2021 withdrawal from neighboring Afghanistan. In a G7 statement, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the U.S., Britain and the European Union said they \"strongly condemn\" anApril 22 Islamist militant attackin which 26 people were killed in India-administered Kashmir. India blamed Pakistan, which denied the accusations and called for a neutral probe. \"We call for immediate de-escalation and encourage both countries to engage in direct dialogue towards a peaceful outcome,\" the G7 top diplomats said.

    "title": "Home skid snapped, Rays seek another win over Brewers",
    "content": "May 10 - The Tampa Bay Rays finally can go into a home game after winning a game at home. The Rays host the Milwaukee Brewers on Saturday afternoon with fresh memories of a 4-3 victory in the series opener that snapped Tampa Bay's seven-game home losing streak. Taylor Walls' bases-loaded walk with two outs in the eighth inning broke a 3-3 tie, and rookie Eric Orze pitched the ninth for his second save. \"Damn good,\" Walls said, when asked how it felt to finally prevail in a home game. \"I don't remember (winning) being this tough. But we're going to have to work our tails off if it is.\" Milwaukee reliever Jared Koenig was off the plate with the 3-2 pitch that gave the Rays the win. \"Just trying to be aggressive and get something I could handle ... It was a grind, I guess.\" Walls said about the walk. \"... 3-2, he missed. Just in.\" Rays left fielder Chandler Simpson made Orze's job easier by diving to catch Daz Cameron's pop fly leading off the top of the ninth. Tampa Bay reliever Cole Sulser got the win despite blowing a lead in the top of the eighth. Tampa Bay will send Taj Bradley (3-2, 4.43 ERA) to the mound on Saturday. The right-hander is coming off a road win against the New York Yankees on Sunday, when he allowed two runs and four hits in 5 1/3 innings with three walks and a strikeout. The Brewers probably hope the Saturday game will feature more traditional plays at key moments. In addition to losing on the bases-loaded walk, an obstruction call against Milwaukee third baseman Caleb Durbin in the sixth gave the Rays a 3-2 lead. With Christopher Morel on third base, Junior Caminero on first and two outs, Caminero took off for second. Catcher William Contreras fired to second base, but Caminero retreated to first. The throw then went to third, and it appeared that Morel was tagged out. However, the umpire ruled that Durbin blocked the base, and Morel was awarded home and Caminero second. Brewers manager Pat Murphy was ejected for arguing the call. \"All I'm going to tell you is I still disagree with it,\" Murphy said after the game. \"They tell me I'm wrong because anytime you argue it, they tell you you're wrong and they give you their judgmental opinion. \"The bottom line is that you can never be right and then you get a fine and nobody says a word.\" Said Durbin: \"(Second baseman Brice Turang) did a great job of running the guy back and made the throw to third. Morel got a little too far off, made the throw to me and you're not really thinking in that situation. You just react. I put the tag on him and they called obstruction.\" Righty Tobias Myers (1-0, 3.65 ERA) is scheduled to start for Milwaukee on Saturday. He got his first win of the season on Monday against the Houston Astros, when he allowed a run and six hits in 5 1/3 innings. He did not walk a batter and struck out two. Both Bradley and Myers will be facing the opposing team for the first time. Before the Friday game, the Brewers recalled infielder Andruw Monasterio and left-handed pitcher Bryan Hudson from Triple-A Nashville while designating infielder Vinny Capra for assignment. Monasterio entered the series opener as a pinch runner and stayed in to play first base. --Field Level Media",

    "title": "Zurich like a local",
    "content": "Few landlocked cities offer an alluring tableau for the dawn like Zurich. Switzerland's biggest city sits on the LimmatRiver at the top of Lake Zurich, which on clear days sparkles brilliantly, framed by the Alps, when the sun rises in the east. I am a relative newcomer,having arrived here last year to cover Switzerland and Austria as chief correspondent for Reuters after 13 years in our Mexico City bureau and Berlin before that. But already I have made my home in this city that boasts a rare conjunction of cultural vibrancy, great wealth and historical curiosity. Larger-than-life figures as different as Vladimir Lenin, Albert Einstein, James Joyce and Ozzy Osbourne drifted in and out of the city during the tumult of the last century. Ranging from multi-million-dollar mansions overlooking the lake to grungy bars in the inner city that feed a pulsating nightlife, Zurich is a study in contradictions, even as the rising cost of housing slowly gentrifies the web of neighbourhoods fanning out from its huge central train station. Here are my tips on how to explore this global financial hub like a local: Getting around:Run by the local transport operator ZVV, Zurich has a highly efficient public transit system, with trains, buses and trams crisscrossing the urban sprawl and the canton of Zurich, Switzerland's most populous. Visitors can also rely on rented electric scooters and bikes, although the inner city is small enough to be traversed by foot, weather permitting. Where to go:Kunsthaus Zürichis Switzerland's biggest art museum, housing famous works from Swiss-born artists such as Alberto Giacometti, Henry Fuseli and Ferdinand Hodler, as well as international heavyweights like Claude Monet, Edvard Munch and Vincent van Gogh. Recently expanded to embrace two separate buildings connected by an underground tunnel, the Kunsthaus hosts regular exhibitions and, in a nod to its complex history, features guidance on whether its paintings were acquired as a result of looting by the Nazis in World War Two. Notable landmarks:A walk through the old city wends eventually to theCabaret Voltaireat Spiegelgasse 1, the birthplace of Dadaism, a pioneering movement which helped to make the names of artists like Marcel Duchamp, Max Ernst, Sophie Taeuber-Arp, John Heartfield and Man Ray. A few doors down at Spiegelgasse 14 is the flat where Vladimir Lenin lived during World War One in the run-up to the Russian revolutions that shook the world in 1917. Not far away and half a century later, Birmingham-born heavy metal pioneers Black Sabbath and their frontman Ozzy Osbourne shook the foundations of the Hotel Hirschen in the dying days of the 1960s during an earlyresidency. Zurich frequently ranks as one of the world's most expensive cities, and for visitors eager to splash some cash, a stroll down Bahnhofstrasse from the station to the lake presents myriad opportunities to buy luxury watches, jewellery and clothes. Bahnhofstrasse bounds the western edge of the old city, an area which straddles both sides of the Limmat and contains many of Zurich's most celebrated buildings. Rising skywards on the river's right bank are the two towers of theGrossmünster church, a noted landmark and one of the cradles of the Protestant Reformation; facing it on the left bank stands the green steeple of theFraumünster, a church renowned for its ornate stained-glass windows, including a beautiful series by Marc Chagall. A few blocks north lies one of Zurich's more unlikely treasures — spectacular frescos in the vaulted entrance hall to the city's police headquarters painted by Augusto Giacometti, a cousin of famed sculptor Alberto. By the lake:In the summer, those game for a swim can jump in the lake — whose temperatures reach a comfortable 20°C (68°F) — before cooling off with a drink at one of the many beer gardens or bars that hug the shoreline. Those set on longer walks can follow the lake into municipalities abutting Zurich. Kilchberg on the western shore is home to chocolate maker Lindt and the final resting place of Nobel-Prize winning writer Thomas Mann, a German exile who came back to Switzerland after living in the U.S. during World War Two. Upon the eastern slopes of Zurichis the grave of Irish writer James Joyce, who wrote much of his novel \"Ulysses\" while living in the city. The cemetery where Joyce is buried sits on a hill behind the domed campus of the ETH Zurich, one of Europe's most distinguished universities and the alma mater of Albert Einstein, who taught therein the 1910s. What to eat:For those looking for more than cheese and chocolate, the classic Zurich dish is Zürcher Geschnetzeltes — strips of fried veal in a creamy mushroom sauce served up with Roesti, a bed of grated and fried potatoes. In theRheinfelder Bierhalle, on the edge of the old town, a plate of Geschnetzeltes costs 33.50 Swiss francs ($41); in theKronenhalle, an institution of Zurich high society, it is 63 francs ($77). Panoramic views: After allthat Geschnetzeltes, you might feel a good walk is in order. For anyone keen to tackle a small mountain, the Uetliberg on Zurich's southwestern flank offers panoramic views of the city, the lake and the surrounding countryside. Close enough to walk to from central Zurich, paths to the top can be easily reached from the Albisgüetli and Triemli tram stops, while a train takes passengers close to the summit. Hikers will also find plenty of water fountains, whose ubiquity is a noted hallmark of Zurich. Biggest faux pas: Should you make any appointments with Swiss people in Zurich, be punctual. Like their highly efficient trains, the Swiss tend to be on time. Public transport is an orderly environment, so try to be discreet when using such shared spaces — don't make a racket.

    "content": "This is an excerpt of the Sustainable Switch Climate Focus newsletter, where we make sense of companies and governments grappling with climate change on Fridays. To receive the full newsletter in your inbox for free sign uphere. Hello! After focusing on the myriad environment, social and governance rollbacks in the United States this week, today’s newsletter turns its attention to Europe. This week, the European Parliament gave its backing tosoften its EU CO2 emissions targetsfor cars and vans and reduce potential fines for automakers. Following heavy lobbying, the European Commission proposed allowing automakers to meet the targets based on their average emissions over the period 2025-2027, rather than just this year. EU lawmakers voted by 458 votes to 101 in favor of the change. There were 14 abstentions. European manufacturers had warned that enforcing the targets this year could have resulted in fines of up to 15 billion euros ($17 billion), given the goals rely on selling more electric vehicles – a segment they say is lagging behind Chinese and U.S. rivals. Critics say the auto industry has had seven years to prepare for the 2025 targets and that the 15 billion euro estimate for fines is vastly inflated. The European Commission also wants to “slash red tape” in itsenergy policies, according to draft conclusions for a summit of EU energy ministers next month seen by Reuters. The draft conclusions backed the plans to simplify more EU laws, and said this \"is expected to have a profound impact on lowering the regulatory burden for companies in the energy sector and energy intensive industries while maintaining alignment with the original policy objectives.\" The EU's simplification efforts have met mixed reactions so far. Some industries have backed the plans as a boost to their competitiveness, while large companies said they offered little relief from bureaucracy, and some investors and campaigners criticized the weakening of sustainability rules as a blow to Europe's efforts to curb climate change.

    "content": "NEW DELHI, May 10 (Reuters) - Monsoon rains are expected to hit India's southern coast on May 27, five days earlier than usual, marking the earliest arrival in at least five years, the weather office said, raising hopes for bumper harvests of crops such as rice, corn, and soybean. The monsoon, the lifeblood of the country's $4 trillion economy, delivers nearly 70% of the rain that India needs to water farms and recharge aquifers and reservoirs. Nearly half of India's farmland, without any irrigation cover, depends on the annual June-September rains to grow a number of crops. Forecasts of early and abundant monsoon rains are expected to alleviate concerns about potential risks to food supplies amid the currentmilitary conflictbetween India, the world's most populous nation, and its neighbour Pakistan. Summer rains usually begin to lash the southernmost coasts of Kerala state around June 1 and spread across the whole country by mid-July, triggering the planting of crops such as rice, corn, cotton, soybeans, and sugarcane. The monsoon onset over Kerala is likely to be on May 27, with a model error of plus/minus four days, the India Meteorological Department said on Saturday. Last year, the monsoon reached the coast of Kerala on May 30, and overall summer rains were the highest since 2020, helping the country recover from a drought of 2023. The India Meteorological Department last monthforecastabove-average monsoon rains for the second straight year in 2025. The department defines average or normal rainfall as ranging between 96% and 104% of a 50-year average of 87 cm (35 inches) for the four-month season. Early monsoon rains will encourage farmers in India, the world's largest rice exporter, to start planting earlier. Reutersreportedlast week that a bumper crop would limit any rebound in global rice prices this year.",

    "title": "Slovak PM derides EU attempts to keep him from Moscow war commemorations",
    "content": "May 10 (Reuters) - Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said on Friday his country wanted to develop relations with Russia, and he derided those in the European Union who he said created obstacles to his attendance at World War Two commemorations in Moscow. Fico broke ranks with the EU by visiting Moscow late last year, more than two years after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. He met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Kremlin late on Friday evening following the Red Square parade marking the 80th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany. China's Xi Jinping was among several dozen leaders at the commemorations, but nearly all Western leaders stayed away. Fico arrived after a circuitous journey made necessary by EU members' barring his aircraft from their airspace. \"As a head of government, I want to assure you that it is in my interest to have pragmatic relations with the Russian Federation,\" Russian news agencies quoted Fico as telling Putin. He said he opposed the creation of any new \"iron curtain and pledge to do everything so that we can shake hands across a curtain\". \"Let us consider as a childish joke all the technical problems we confronted, created by our European Union colleagues.\" Putin said Russia appreciated Fico's decision to attend despite the \"logistical obstacles that were created. But you are nonetheless here.\" Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, had criticised Fico's attendance at the Moscow ceremonies. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said attending the victory parade and \"applauding President Putin...brings shame to everyone who is there.\" In a response to Kallas' comments on Facebook, Fico said he was paying tribute to Soviet Red Army soldiers who had liberated Slovakia in the war. Kallas had no right to criticise him, Fico said, as it was normal to hold a dialogue with other leaders. Fico also told Putin he was prepared to use a national veto to oppose plans by the 27-nation EU to phase out Russian energy purchases should the proposal come up for a unanimous vote. But under the European Commission's legal proposals due in June, approval would require a qualified majority of member states - which means one or two countries could not block the plan and Slovakia would likely be outvoted. Slovakia and Hungary had earlier voiced opposition to the plan. Fico described the proposal as \"simply economic suicide\".",

    "title": "China takes centre stage in Philippines' feisty midterm election",
    "content": "MANILA, May 10 (Reuters) - In political rallies, Senate hearings and voter surveys ahead of Monday's midterm elections in the Philippines, China has been an overwhelming - and unusual - presence. The shadow of its giant maritime neighbour has loomed over the Philippines for years, but as the country's two most prominent political clans flex their muscles in the usually low-key process to pick senators and local government leaders, relations with China have emerged as a political lightning rod. The outcome could end up shaping the country's strategic positioning over the remaining half of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr's six-year term, which began in 2022. \"Will we allow ourselves to return to the time when our leaders wanted us to become a province of China?\" Marcos asked voters at a rally in February, in a dig at predecessor Rodrigo Duterte and his daughter Sara, who is currently vice president and a key Marcos rival. During his 2016 to 2022 term, Duterte shifted foreign policy on China, adopting conciliatory rhetoric and downplaying disputes in the South China Sea. The strategy drew concern from Washington and raised questions about the Philippines' longstanding security alliance with the United States. In contrast, Marcos has moved torekindle and deepenties with Washington. \"These are hot button issues that many Filipino voters can relate to, particularly on the issue on China. There was a time in the past when foreign policy did not really matter that much during elections,\" said Ederson Tapia, professor of public administration at the University of Makati. \"But now it does.\" An April survey found that a majority of voters in the country of 110 million prefer candidates who assert Philippine sovereignty in the South China Sea, where the Marcos-led administration has taken a more assertive stance in itsmaritime confrontationswith Beijing, which continue unabated. It is a sentiment that Marcos has tapped into since he started his campaign for the slate of Senate candidates that he is backing. In the February rally, Marcos pointed to his candidates, saying: \"None of them were applauding China when our coast guard was being bombed with water, when our fishermen were being blocked, when their catch was stolen, and our islands seized to become part of another country.\" China's embassy in Manila did not respond to questions from Reuters. The Duterte camp enjoyed a surge of sympathy when he wasarrestedby the International Criminal Court in March and taken to The Hague, but Marcos' candidates remain ahead in polls and appear poised to dominate the Senate race. A Duterte spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Through a months-long campaign, Marcos has kept up the pressure and focused on China as a key election issue, while his allies have taken aim at Sara Duterte for her silence on China's actions. Sara, a likely future presidential candidate, was once a Marcos ally but now faces animpeachment trialon charges including a threat toassassinatethe president if she herself was harmed. In the Philippines, the 24-member Senate acts as thejuryin any impeachment trial, making the midterms even more consequential in determining Sara Duterte's political future. Sara, who has denied wrongdoing, has responded to her impeachment with defiance, asking the Supreme Court tonullifythe complaint against her. A strong mandate for Marcos would not only define his ability to govern decisively in the remaining three years of his term, but would also shape the 2028 presidential race, said Victor Andres \"Dindo\" Manhit, a political analyst and founder of Stratbase Group, a research and advisory firm. Marcos is limited to a single term under the Constitution and is expected to anoint a successor. If she survives impeachment, Sara Duterte would also be eligible to run in 2028. \"Those who will run need to be tested on consistency with regard to these issues,\" Manhit said, referring to the protection of Philippines' maritime rights and sovereignty. \"And one of them is the current vice president. She has not spoken against this coercion by China.\" A spokesperson for Sara Duterte did not respond to a request for comment. The midterm election comes amid a proliferation of disinformation in the Philippines. Up to 45% of discussions about the elections on social media have been driven by inauthentic accounts,Reuters reportedlast month. The use of fake accounts and paid influencers for political operations is widespread in the Philippines, but a top security official and a senator alleged last month that Chinese state-sponsored groups might beattempting to influence Filipinos. China's foreign ministry and its embassy in Manila have rejected the accusations.",

    "content": "MOSCOW, May 10 (Reuters) - Russia would require a halt to U.S. and European arms supplies to Ukraine during any potential ceasefire, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in aninterview, opens new tabwith ABC News. \"Otherwise it will be an advantage for Ukraine. Ukraine will continue their total mobilisation, bringing new troops to (the) frontline,\" Peskov said. \"Ukraine will use this period to train new military personnel and to give a rest to their existing ones. So why should we grant such an advantage to Ukraine?\" U.S. President Donald Trump urged Russia and Ukraine on Friday to \"get this stupid war finished\", as he pushed for a 30-day ceasefire that Ukraine says it is willing to agree to. But Peskov, in the interview, restated Russian concerns thatPutin had made publicas far back as March 13 and set out in a phone call with Trump on March 18. \"A ceasefire was supported by President Putin, but he asked several questions. He said that right now we have certain dynamics on the front, Russian troops are advancing, and advancing in quite a confident way,\" he said. \"So if we speak about ceasefire, what are we going to do with shipments of weapons coming every day from the United States and from European countries?\" His comments underlined the lack of any shift in Russia's position on a ceasefire since mid-March. During that time Trump, who previously had applied intense pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has shown growing impatience with Russia and questioned whether Putin was \"tapping me along\". Peskov denied that was the case, and said it was Ukraine that was refusing to enter direct negotiations. \"President Putin is doing whatever is possible to solve the problem, to achieve a settlement through peaceful and diplomatic means. But having no peaceful and diplomatic means at hand, we have to continue the military operation,\" he said. Russia hoped that mediation by Trump would help to bring \"a little bit more flexibility, a little bit more political will and wisdom to the Kyiv regime\", Peskov said. Putin declared a brief Easter ceasefire last month, which both sides accused each other of violating countless times, and another three-day pause this week as Russia marks the 80th anniversary of victory in World War Two. Ukraine did not agree to the latest truce, saying it wanted a halt of 30 days or more.",

    "content": "May 10 - Looking to win a seventh straight game for the first time in three seasons, the visiting St. Louis Cardinals can clinch a series win against the struggling Washington Nationals on Saturday afternoon. Fresh off a 10-0 victory over Washington on Friday, St. Louis has won its last three games by a combined score of 17-1. In the opener of the three-game set, former Nationals pitcher Erick Fedde hurled a six-hit shutout against Washington. Fedde extended the Cardinals' recent pitching success, as the club's last three starters have surrendered just one run over the last 23 innings. St. Louis' winning streak is its longest since they won eight in a row in August 2022. \"We just saw him do something special,\" Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol said of Fedde. \"It was cool to see him navigate that lineup. When you look at (Washington), they're a left-match all the way through, so for him to be able to go through that lineup the way they've been swinging, he had everything working.\" Another righty will take the mound for St. Louis on Saturday, as Andre Pallante (2-2, 4.75 ERA) makes his eighth start of the season. Pallante, 26, has gone four consecutive starts without picking up a victory, including last Sunday, when he allowed four earned runs in just 3 1/3 innings in a no-decision against the New York Mets. The Cardinals won 5-4. Pallante has faced the Nationals five times (one start) in his career, posting a 1-1 record and a 7.36 ERA. Washington enters Saturday having lost three straight while allowing 27 runs. Starter Mitchell Parker allowed four runs in four innings on Friday, before the bullpen gave up six runs in the final five frames. \"This one wasn't good,\" Nationals manager Davey Martinez said postgame. \"I'm sitting here trying to figure out what went wrong. Mitchell struggled. Walks. Fell behind. Our offense just couldn't get it going. We came in after a day off. We were playing well. I'm just going to try to really forget about this one.\" The Nationals' 5.47 ERA is the third highest in the majors, only better than the Colorado Rockies (5.56) and Miami Marlins (5.86). Another struggling hurler, veteran right-hander Trevor Williams (2-3, 5.86), will start for Washington. The 33-year-old hasn't gone more than 5 1/3 innings in any of his five starts this season, but is coming off a victory against the Cincinnati Reds last Saturday, allowing four runs in 5 1/3 innings in an 11-6 win. Williams, a longtime National League Central rival of the Cardinals while with the Pittsburgh Pirates, is 5-6 with a 4.93 ERA in 22 career appearances (17 starts) against St. Louis. --Field Level Media",

Medical personnel appeared to be administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation to King after she went down in the 74th minute of the game. She was carted off the field with an oxygen mask on her face. Players from both teams gathered in a prayer circle, and the match was delayed 10 minutes. Angel City tweeted postgame, \"Savy was transported by EMS to the hospital following a medical event on the field. She is responsive and undergoing further evaluation. We thank everyone for their concern and support.\" Angel City assistant coach Eleri Earnshaw said following the team's 2-0 victory, \"Her family is with her, as is our medical staff, so she's in good hands.\" Utah coach Jimmy Coenraets said postgame, \"In those moments, I'm not sure we should have continued the game. ... Not only them, but also our players were just scared. I think that's not the right position and not the right situation to be in. \"But in the end we played on, and that's a decision that other people are making, which is fine.

    "content": "May 10 - Atlanta's AJ Smith-Shawver is coming off a career-best performance as he prepares to oppose Pittsburgh's Andrew Heaney when the Braves take on the host Pirates on Saturday afternoon. Smith-Shawver ((2-2, 3.00 ERA) carried a no-hitter into the eighth inning and gave up only one hit over eight innings while striking out five and issuing four walks in a 4-0 win on Monday against the visiting Cincinnati Reds. An eighth-inning single by the Reds' Santiago Espinal ended his bid to record the first Braves no-hitter since Kent Mercker on April 8, 1994. \"That's what you dream of as a kid, going out there and playing the game that you love,\" Smith-Shawver said. \"I'm just trying to take it all in right now.\" Smith-Shawver has been solid in his two starts since being recalled from the minors on April 29. After going 0-2 with a 4.61 ERA over his first three outings this season, Smith-Shawver is 2-0 with a 1.35 ERA over his past two starts (13 1/3 innings). \"Those are big steps mentally for him,\" Braves manager Brian Snitker said. \"Those are the makeup things you look for in a young guy, how he handles adversity. He's been dealt a lot in a brief major league career.\" If Smith-Shawver, who will face the Pirates for the first time, can continue to build off his recent start, he could solidify a spot in the Braves rotation. The Braves, who have struggled offensively at times of late, will try to provide some run support to their 22-year-old rookie right-hander. Atlanta couldn't find its offense until the ninth inning on Friday when it nearly rallied from a 3-0 deficit before losing 3-2. Meanwhile, Heaney (2-3, 3.18) is coming off his worst outing of the season when he matched a season-high four runs on a season-high eight hits, walked four and struck out three over 3 2/3 innings in a 4-0 home loss on Sunday to the San Diego Padres. He'll try to recover his form from earlier this season and try to help the Pirates string together some positive results after snapping a seven-game losing streak on Friday. Pittsburgh won in Don Kelly's managerial debut and belted a pair of home runs in a game for the first time since April 27 when Alexander Canario hit his second of the season and Jared Triolo blasted his first. \"We've been scarce for runs so to see the ball go over the fence felt really good,\" Triolo said during the Pirates' postgame broadcast. Heaney has struggled over his past two starts, which have lasted a combined 8 1/3 innings and gave up four runs in each outing. Over Heaney's first five starts this season, he compiled a 1.72 ERA, allowing six runs in 31 1/3 innings, and striking out 31 while issuing only six walks. Heaney is 0-0 with a 5.00 ERA in two career starts against the Braves. \"Keep being aggressive in the zone and then making more quality pitches in big counts,\" Heaney said after his most recent start. \"I think I did a good job early on, 1-1, 2-2 and when it was time to make a good pitch, I did. Here, I think I've kinda been falling behind or letting guys have free passes.\" --Field Level Media",

    "content": "May 10 (Reuters) - Brazil's two-time world champion Felipe Toledo beat Australian wildcard Julian Wilson to win the Gold Coast Pro in an instant pro surfing classic on Saturday, a decade after the two met at the finals of the same event. The 36-year-old Wilson stepped away from the tour in 2021 as COVID travel restrictions and the demands of a young family took a toll, but has targeted 2025 as his comeback year and won the trials to get a spot in the main event. Wilson took down a number of top surfers, including 2019 world champion Italo Ferreira and Japan's 2020 Tokyo Olympic silver medallist Kanoa Igarashi on his run to the final with some of the biggest and most technical aerials seen all season. But Toledo, who rejoined the tour this year after taking a mental health break in 2024, was also in rare form in high quality, head-high waves at the right-hand point break of Burleigh Heads. Toledo scored the event's only perfect 10 for a deep, long tube and alley-oop aerial in his semifinal against compatriot Alejo Muniz and started the final with an excellent score for a full rotation air. Wilson quickly responded with two high-risk spins of his own but his lead was short-lived as Toledo racked up two even better scores, combining searing turns, deep tubes and lofty airs. Toledo's hefty two wave total of 17.60 out of 20 looked to be enough but Wilson refused to give up. He scored an 8.8 late in the final before somewhat controversially winning priority, exchanging some angry words with his rival and catching one last wave as the clock ticked down. Needing another 8.8, his final score was 8.4, leaving him 0.4 points short at 17.20 out of 20 to give Toledo the win - the same result as when they met in the 2015 final. \"It's not easy to step away from the thing you love, to prioritise your family and watch from the sidelines, and these surfers inspire me so much. This is what I was born to do,\" Wilson said, paying credit to Toledo and his chanting Brazilian fans. Hawaii's Bettylou Sakura Johnson broke through to win her first world championship tour event with a dominant performance over Australian veteran Sally Fitzgibbons in the women's finals. Both Fitzgibbons, 34, and Johnson, 20, struggled in the early part of the season, with neither progressing past the quarterfinals in the first five events of the tour. Johnson got off to an ideal start in their final, scoring an 8.5 out of 10 for a series of powerful turns on a fast-grinding wave. Before her rival could get a decent score, Johnson backed it up for a 6.5 and a 15-point heat total. \"This is the best feeling in the world and I'm over the moon to have my first win here on the Gold Coast,\" said Johnson. \"Yeah, this is what winning feels like and I want to keep winning.\" The wins boost both Johnson and Toledo to sixth in the world. The tour next heads to the Margaret River Pro in Western Australia for stop number seven, after which the men's and women's fields will be cut by a third for the remaining four events. The top five surfers will then face off in a one-day, winner-takes-all finale in Fiji in August.",

    "content": "May 10 (Reuters) - Australia winger Joseph Suaalii will miss New South Wales Waratahs' Super Rugby Pacific clash against the Canterbury Crusaders next week due to concussion after he was stretchered off in his side's 28-21 loss to the Queensland Reds on Friday. Suaalii sustained a blow to the head just before halftime when he collided with teammate Andrew Kellaway at Sydney Football Stadium, but Waratahs coach Dan McKellar said the 21-year-old had not required hospitalisation after the incident. \"We've got access to vision and the analyst told me pretty quickly that he'd got a knee to the head,\" McKellar told Australian media. \"The medical staff were on there quickly and gave him the support that he needed. \"He's with his mum and dad now back home, so he'll be OK. Obviously he just gave everyone a fright; you don't want to see any player down on the ground, knocked out.\" Suaalii joined the Waratahs this season after making a high-profile switch from rugby league's Sydney Roosters and is expected to feature prominently when Australia take on the British and Irish Lions in July and August. He will be sidelined for a minimum of 12 days due to concussion protocols in place in Super Rugby.",

    "title": "MLB roundup: Jasson Dominguez's 3 HRs propel Yankees past A's",
    "content": "May 10 - Jasson Dominguez established career highs of three homers and seven RBIs to help the New York Yankees post a 10-2 victory over the Athletics on Friday night at West Sacramento, Calif. The switch-hitting Dominguez hit a solo shot from the left side in the third inning, a bases-empty blast while hitting right-handed in the seventh and blew the game open from the left side with a grand slam in the eighth. Dominguez, who never previously had more than one homer or three RBIs in a game, also drove in a run with a sacrifice fly. At 22 years and 91 days old, he became the youngest Yankee ever to produce a three-homer game. Will Warren (2-2) pitched a career-long 7 1/3 innings and held the Athletics to four hits. The lone run charged to Warren scored after he exited the game, when reliever Mark Leiter Jr. yielded an RBI single to Jacob Wilson. Paul Goldschmidt also homered as the Yankees racked up 14 hits to win their third straight game. Goldschmidt, J.C. Escarra, Ben Rice and Jorbit Vivas each had two hits for New York. Nick Kurtz had two hits for the Athletics, who also received an RBI single by Lawrence Butler while losing their third consecutive contest. Dodgers 14, Diamondbacks 11 Shohei Ohtani had three hits, and his three-run homer capped a six-run ninth inning as Los Angeles rallied past Arizona in Phoenix. Los Angeles overcame a three-run deficit after squandering a five-run lead. Ohtani hit a 1-2 pitch from Ryan Thompson with one out to break a tie at 11-11. Earlier in the inning, Andy Pages and Enrique Hernandez had RBI doubles and Max Muncy tied it with an RBI single off Kevin Ginkel (0-1), who gave up four straight hits to open the ninth. Lourdes Gurriel Jr. had a grand slam and five RBIs, Ketel Marte homered twice and Eugenio Suarez and Randal Grichuk also went deep for the D-backs in the slugfest, which featured seven homers and 14 extra-base hits. Ohtani added two doubles and four RBIs and Hernandez had a homer, three hits and three runs for the Dodgers, who earned their major-league-leading 14th comeback victory. Tigers 2, Rangers 1 Tarik Skubal set down the first 15 batters he faced and recorded a season-high 12 strikeouts as streaking Detroit edged visiting Texas. Skubal (4-2) allowed one run on two hits in seven innings. His strikeout total was one shy of his career high. Colt Keith had two hits, scored a run and drove in another for the Tigers, who have won five straight and eight of their last nine games. Texas starter Patrick Corbin (2-2) gave up two runs and three hits in seven innings. Sam Haggerty's RBI single accounted for the Rangers' run. Texas has lost 12 of its last 16 games. Pirates 3, Braves 2 Bailey Falter threw six shutout innings and allowed two hits to help host Pittsburgh beat Atlanta and snap a seven-game losing streak. The Pirates triumphed in Don Kelly's debut as Pirates manager, which came one day after Derek Shelton was fired after six seasons in Pittsburgh. Falter (2-3) struck out three and walked two on 89 pitches. But closer Dennis Santana nearly let the advantage slip away before locking down his fourth save. The Braves didn't have an extra-base hit until Eli White tripled off Santana to lead off the ninth. White scored two batters later on a sacrifice fly by Michael Harris II. Santana then allowed a single to Alex Verdugo and an RBI single to Drake Baldwin. Cardinals 10, Nationals 0 Erick Fedde threw the first complete game of his career and Willson Contreras drove in three runs as visiting St. Louis rocked Washington. Fedde (3-3) allowed six hits while striking out eight and walking none across 109 pitches, marking the fourth complete game thrown in the majors this season. Nolan Arenado had three hits, while Ivan Herrera drove in a pair of runs for the Cardinals, who extended their winning streak to six games. Mitchell Parker (3-3) allowed four runs on seven hits in his four-inning stint for Washington. CJ Abrams had three of the Nationals' six hits, as the club dropped its third straight game. Padres 13, Rockies 9 Gavin Sheets knocked in four runs, Martin Maldonado launched a homer and visiting San Diego became the latest team to batter Colorado's pitching staff in Denver. Sheets' three-run double capped a four-run third inning that gave San Diego a 5-0 lead, and he added an RBI double during a five-run fifth. Maldonado finished off the fifth with a two-run homer to left, his second of the year, in the opener of a three-game set. Randy Vasquez (2-3) earned his first win since April 9, allowing six hits and two runs in six innings. Antonio Senzatela (1-6) suffered the loss after giving up nine hits and eight runs (four earned) over 4 2/3 innings. Colorado fell to 6-32 with its seventh straight loss. Mets 7, Cubs 2 Host New York hit four solo home runs and Clay Holmes gave up just one run in six innings en route to a win over Chicago. Holmes (5-1) gave up just three hits and lowered his ERA to 2.74. The Mets have won seven straight games started by Holmes, who gave up a solo home run to Kyle Tucker in the fourth inning. It was the first home run Holmes allowed in a Mets uniform, after 39 2/3 innings. Jameson Taillon, who had held left-handed batters to a .161 average coming into the game, gave up homers to left-handed-hitting Francisco Lindor, Brett Baty, Jeff McNeil and Juan Soto in the first four innings. Taillon (2-2) threw 100 pitches in four innings, permitting six runs, five earned, on nine hits. Rays 4, Brewers 3 Taylor Walls drew a bases-loaded walk with two outs in the eighth inning to break a tie and give Tampa Bay a win over visiting Milwaukee. Walls took a 3-2 pitch well below the strike zone from loser Jared Koenig (2-1), who gave up two hits and a walk in the inning to load the bases. The Rays snapped a three-game losing streak overall and a seven-game skid at home. Cole Sulser (1-1) got the win. Tampa Bay's Brandon Lowe hit a solo home run in the bottom of the fourth to tie the game at 2-2. Starter Zack Littell gave up two runs in six innings. Astros 3, Reds 0 Hunter Brown posted his fourth scoreless start of the season and host Houston registered a shutout victory over Cincinnati in the opener of a three-game interleague series. The Astros snapped a nine-game losing streak to the Reds behind another strong start from Brown (6-1), who finished an out shy of recording his eighth quality start in as many appearances this season. Although he issued a season-high four walks in 5 2/3 innings, Brown surrendered only two hits and recorded a season-high-tying nine strikeouts for a fourth consecutive outing. Reds right-hander Nick Martinez (1-4) proved relatively elusive over his six innings. He allowed a season-high 10 hits but did not issue a walk. Guardians 6, Phillies 0 Angel Martinez hit a two-run home run, Jose Ramirez and Kyle Manzardo had solo shots and Gavin Williams pitched five scoreless innings as Cleveland beat visiting Philadelphia. Manzardo belted a 411-foot shot to center in the fourth and Martinez hit his first home run of the season in the fifth, both off Phillies starter Aaron Nola (1-6) in the opener of the three-game interleague series. Ramirez went deep in the seventh against Joe Ross, helping the Guardians to their 20th victory in 29 games since April 8. Kyle Schwarber of the Phillies extended his on-base streak to a career-high 44 games with a walk, one shy of Odubel Herrera for the fourth-longest run in franchise history. The last player with a 44-game streak was New York Yankees superstar Aaron Judge in 2022-2023. White Sox 6, Marlins 2 Chicago broke a tie game with three runs in the seventh inning and went on to snap a four-game losing streak with a win over visiting Miami. Andrew Vaughn hit a solo homer for Chicago, which bounced back after allowing 17 hits in a 10-0 loss to the Kansas City Royals on Thursday. Cam Booser (1-3) recorded two outs in the seventh inning for the win. Liam Hicks homered for Miami, which lost for the 10th time in its last 12 games. The Marlins were 1-for-15 with runners in scoring position and left 11 runners on base. Royals 2, Red Sox 1 (12 innings) Freddy Fermin roped an RBI single in the 12th inning, after Michael Lorenzen and Hunter Dobbins both delivered stellar starts, and Kansas City recorded a season-high seventh straight win, edging Boston. After Cavan Biggio's sacrifice bunt moved placement runner Michael Massey to third, Fermin dropped a Sean Newcomb pitch into left field to send the Royals to their 16th win in 18 games. Lorenzen allowed just three hits and struck out seven without a walk through seven innings. The rookie Dobbins lowered his ERA to 2.78 after giving up five hits over six innings. Boston's Rafael Devers and Kansas City's Vinnie Pasquantino each had an RBI in the 11th. Twins 3, Giants 1 Chris Paddack took a perfect game into the sixth inning, Byron Buxton had a hand in two of his team's three runs and Minnesota won a sixth straight game, beating visiting San Francisco in the opener of a three-game interleague series. Paddack (1-3) retired the first 17 Giants he faced before Christian Koss, the No. 9 hitter, singled to center with two outs in the sixth. Paddack lost his shutout bid when Matt Chapman hit a solo shot in the seventh. Minnesota's Trevor Larnach and Carlos Correa each hit an RBI single and Harrison Bader scored on an error. Giants starter Jordan Hicks (1-4) completed six innings, during which he allowed all three Minnesota runs and seven hits. Orioles 4, Angels 1 Tomoyuki Sugano threw 7 1/3 impressive innings, Gunnar Henderson homered and hit an RBI triple and Baltimore ended a five-game losing streak with a victory over Los Angeles in Anaheim, Calif. Sugano (4-2) allowed one run and three hits, and Felix Bautista pitched a 1-2-3 ninth for his seventh save. Jackson Holliday and Emmanuel Rivera each had two hits and an RBI for the Orioles. Angels starter Kyle Hendricks (1-4) yielded three runs on six hits in five-plus innings. Yoan Moncado tripled and scored a run. Blue Jays 6, Mariners 3 Addison Barger hit three doubles, drove in two runs and made one of Toronto's several sterling defensive plays in a victory over host Seattle in the opener of a three-game series. Nathan Lukes homered for the Blue Jays, who won their second straight following a four-game skid. Blue Jays starter Kevin Gausman (3-3) allowed three runs on seven hits over 5 1/3 innings. Mariners starter Luis Castillo (3-3) gave up five runs on seven hits in five innings. Julio Rodriguez and Randy Arozarena each had two hits, while Arozarena, Jorge Polanco and Leody Taveras each notched an RBI. --Field Level Media Osvaldo Bido (2-3) allowed four runs (three earned) and eight hits over 5 1/3 innings. He struck out six and walked two. Goldschmidt came up with two outs in the third and fell behind 0-2 before hammering a slider over the fence in center for a 1-0 lead. Two pitches later, Dominguez whacked a changeup over the wall in right-center. New York tacked on a run in the fifth when Trent Grisham scored on Dominguez's sacrifice fly to left. --Field Level Media",

    "title": "Reds acquire Connor Joe in trade with Padres",
    "content": "May 10 - Connor Joe saw his brief stint with his hometown franchise end on Friday, as the San Diego Padres traded the outfielder/first baseman to the Cincinnati Reds. The Padres received minor league right-hander Andrew Moore and cash in the deal. Joe most recently was playing for Triple-A El Paso after going 0-for-9 with six strikeouts in seven games for the Padres this year. He signed a one-year, $1 million contract with San Diego in February. Joe was born in San Diego, went to nearby Poway High School and played at the University of San Diego. The 32-year-old right-handed hitter previously played in the majors for the San Francisco Giants (2019), the Colorado Rockies (2021-22) and the Pittsburgh Pirates (2023-24). In 445 career games, Joe has a .241 batting average, a .335 on-base percentage, a .389 slugging percentage, 35 homers and 141 RBIs. The Reds cleared a spot for Joe on their 40-man roster by putting Tyler Callihan on the 60-day injured list. The left fielder/second baseman broke his left forearm after colliding with the wall while attempting to make a catch on Monday. Moore, 25, had no decisions and a 4.15 ERA in six relief appearances for Double-A Chattanooga this year. --Field Level Media",

    "content": "CAIRO, May 10 (Reuters) - Egypt's annual urban consumer price inflation accelerated to 13.9% in April from 13.6% in March, matching analyst expectations, data from statistics agency CAPMAS showed on Saturday. Month on month, prices were 1.5% higher at the end of April than at end-March. Food and beverage prices decelerated by 1.5%. Annually, food and beverage prices rose by 6.0%. The median forecast of analysts polled by Reuters was for annual inflation to have climbed to 13.9%. They cited an increase in the official price of fuel as the main cause. Inflation soared following Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in early 2022, which prompted foreign investors to withdraw billions of dollars from Egyptian treasuries. Headline inflation rose by a record 38.0% in September 2023. M2 money supply expanded in the year to end-March, but at a slower rate, dropping to 25.8% from an all-time high of 33.9% at the end of February, central bank data showed. Egypt devalued its currency, raised interest rates by 600 basis points and signed an $8 billion financial support package with the International Monetary Fund in March last year, helping to bring its finances under control.",

Boston scored the game's first run in the 11th, when Rafael Devers' grounder stopped by Royals shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. allowed placement runner Ceddanne Rafaela to score from third. Devers, who also singled, came through one day after he told reporters he would not oblige the team's request for him to play first base. Having already rather unhappily moved from third base to designated hitter this season after Boston acquired Alex Bregman, Devers met with club owner John Henry about this situation. Kansas City, though, tied it via Vinnie Pasquantino's RBI single in the bottom of the 11th. As Dobbins and Lorenzen continued to duel on the mound, Kansas City posted the first real scoring threat in the bottom of the fifth. Kyle Isbel tripled with one out in the frame, but then was thrown out between third base and home on a ground ball to shortstop by Jonathan India, who was also thrown out trying to take second on the play. In the top of the sixth, Boston wasted a leadoff double from Rafaela. Kansas City threatened again in the seventh when Greg Weissert walked the first two batters of the inning. But Mark Canha then hit into a 6-3 double play and Fermin was out on a liner to right fielder Wilyer Abreu. Steven Cruz (1-0) relieved Daniel Lynch IV in the 12th and got two outs for his first career win. --Field Level Media",

    "title": "FIFA approves 48-team women's World Cup from 2031 edition",
    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - The women's World Cup will be expanded from 32 to 48 teams from the 2031 edition onwards after world soccer's governing body FIFA said its Council approved the proposal at a virtual meeting on Friday. The 48-team World Cup will adopt a 12-group format, increasing the total number of matches from 64 to 104 - the same as the expanded men's World Cup in 2026 - and extending the tournament by one week. The 2027 women's World Cup, which will be held in Brazil, will have 32 teams. The 2023 edition in Australia and New Zealand was the first to have 32 teams, up from 24 in the 2019 tournament hosted by France. \"This is not just about having 16 more teams playing in the FIFA Women's World Cup but taking the next steps in relation to the women's game in general,\" FIFA President Gianni Infantino said in a statement. \"...more FIFA member associations have the chance to benefit from the tournament to develop their women's football structures from a holistic point of view.\" The 2026 men's World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the United States, Canada and Mexico, will be the first to have 48 teams. The men's World Cup had 32 teams since the 1998 edition until the last tournament in Qatar in 2022. The United States is poised to be named host of the 2031 women's World Cup as the only bid, marking the third time the country will stage the tournament after previously hosting it in 1999 and 2003. The United Kingdom is thesole bidder for the 2035 tournament. Hosts for the 2031 and 2035 editions are yet to be ratified. Although there are concerns that games could be one-sided with 48 teams, Infantino said the 2023 edition showed sides are closing the gap on the elite. \"The FIFA Women's World Cup 2023, the first in which teams from all confederations won at least one game and teams from five confederations reached the knockout stage, among many other records, set a new standard for global competitiveness,\" he added. \"This decision ensures we are maintaining the momentum in terms of growing women's football globally.\" Players' union FIFPRO welcomed the expansion of the women's World Cup as it demonstrated the growth of women's soccer. \"However, the support of players depends on inclusive decision-making and cooperative planning that respects all stakeholders,\" FIFPRO said in a statement. \"It is critical that the global development of women's competitions goes hand in hand with improved labour conditions and the advancement of players, as well as development further down the pyramid.\"",

    "content": "NEW DELHI, May 9 (Reuters) - The Indian Premier League was suspended for one week on Friday while the Pakistan Super League postponed its remaining matches in the wake of the ongoing conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours. \"The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has decided to suspend the remainder of the ongoing IPL 2025 with immediate effect for one week,\" secretary Devajit Saikia said in a statement on Friday. The IPL governing council consulted the franchises and players and \"considered it prudent to act in the collective interest of all stakeholders\", he said. \"While cricket remains a national passion, there is nothing greater than the nation and its sovereignty, integrity, and security of our country,\" Saikia added. \"The BCCI remains firmly committed to support all efforts that safeguard India and will always align its decisions in the best interest of the nation.\" Asked if players and support staff from abroad had been given the option to return home if they felt uncomfortable, BCCI secretary Saikia told Reuters: \"That's not our domain. It's for the individual franchises to decide what they want to do with their foreign recruits.\" Friday's IPL match in Dharamsala wasabandoned midwaythrough, with organisers citing a power outage, while Sunday's game at the same north Indian citywas shiftedto Ahmedabad because of the border tension. The two countries have clashed since India struck multiple locations in Pakistan on Wednesday that it said were \"terrorist camps\" in retaliation for a deadly attack in its troubled region of Kashmir last month, in which it said Islamabad was involved. Pakistan denied the accusation but both countries have exchanged cross-border firing and shelling and sent drones and missiles into each other's airspace since then, with nearly four dozen people dying in the violence. The IPL still has 12 group matches left, which are due to be followed by the playoffs culminating in the May 25 final in Kolkata. New dates and venues for the remaining matches will be declared \"in due course\", said Saikia. The conflict took its toll on the other side of the border as well with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) initially deciding to move the last eight PSL games to the United Arab Emirates. However, later on Friday, the PCB said it had postponed the matches on the advice of Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, adding that cricket \"must take a respectful pause\" amid the conflict. \"The PCB recognises the efforts and support of its partners, franchises, participating players, broadcasters, sponsors, and organizers in having ensured the smooth conduct of the tournament thus far,\" it said. \"We, at the PCB, also have sincere regard for the mental well-being of participating players and the sentiments of our foreign players, and we respect the concerns of their families who want to see them back home.\"",

    "title": "Man City's Haaland fit again as Guardiola sets sights on Champions League spot",
    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - Manchester City striker Erling Haaland is in contention to start against Southampton this weekend, manager Pep Guardiola said on Friday after the Norwegian striker recovered from an ankle injury that kept him sidelined for nearly six weeks. With 21 goals in the Premier League, Haaland was a contender for the top scorer's Golden Boot award but has slipped to third behind Liverpool's Mohamed Salah (28) and Newcastle United's Alexander Isak (23). City are third in the standings with three games left, three points behind second-placed Arsenal and a point above Newcastle. \"(Haaland) is ready, he's fit. If he starts, we decide (on Saturday),\" Guardiola told reporters. \"Still Rodri is not available. Oscar (Bobb) and Nathan (Ake) started training with us but still not available.\" Southampton sit bottom of the table with 11 points and just two wins all season. However, the already relegated south-coast club have nothing to lose and Guardiola is not taking them lightly as he looks to consolidate a Champions League spot with Chelsea, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa all in the mix. \"We start 0-0 and it is a massive important game for us. Three games left. Huge respect for them,\" he said. On City's current form, having won four straight games, he said: \"It's the best results we've got in a row. In the beginning of the season we did it. In terms of today, we can do better. \"The target when you're not champions is to qualify for the next Champions League season. If we make three victories we'll be there. It's in our hands.\" Despite their troubles earlier this season, City could still finish second and win the FA Cup but Guardiola is not thinking too far ahead. \"I'm not thinking about that, I'm sorry to tell you. It's just Southampton that's on my mind and all week I've been thinking about them,\" he said. \"The rest of the analysis, we will do it at the end of the season.\"",

    "title": "Warriors will have to find new winning formula vs. Wolves in Game 3",
    "content": "May 10 - The Minnesota Timberwolves hope their third California adventure of the postseason proves to be as fruitful as the first two when they tip off a two-game sequence of the Western Conference playoffs against the Golden State Warriors in San Francisco on Saturday night. The teams are scheduled for Game 3 on Saturday and Game 4 on Monday in the best-of-seven series, with the clubs each having won a game when the Western semifinals opened in Minneapolis earlier in the week. As the sixth seed in the West, the Timberwolves were the underdogs when they began their first-round series with a road win over the third-seeded Los Angeles Lakers last month. Minnesota came away from the trip with a split, then never lost again in a 4-1 elimination of the Lakers, a three-game winning streak that included a clinching victory back in L.A. in Game 5. The upset win earned the Timberwolves the home-court advantage over the Warriors, who also pulled a first-round surprise as the West's No. 7 seed, outlasting the Houston Rockets in seven games. When last seen at home, Golden State blew a chance to wrap up the first-round series in six games, dropping a 115-107 decision to the second-seeded Rockets last Friday. The Warriors have been on the road ever since, having returned to Houston for a successful Game 7 before heading straight to Minneapolis for Games 1 and 2. As it did against the Rockets, Golden State gained an immediate upper hand against the Timberwolves with a 99-88 road win on Tuesday. But they lost star guard Stephen Curry to a strained left hamstring in the process. Curry, who sat out Thursday's 117-93 loss in the rematch at Minnesota, already has been ruled out of Games 3 and 4. He is scheduled to be re-evaluated on the eve of Game 5 when the clubs return to the Timberwolves' home floor. Coincidentally, the Warriors were without Jimmy Butler when they hosted the Rockets in Game 3 after the key in-season acquisition suffered a pelvic contusion in Houston. That didn't stop Golden State from going up 2-1 in the series behind Curry's 36 points in the first of consecutive home games, before Butler returned to contribute 27 points to a Game 4 victory. If there was a positive to Thursday's blowout, it was that Warriors coach Steve Kerr was able to experiment with different combinations in an effort to find new sources of production that could help minimize the impact of Curry being out. Jonathan Kuminga, who saw action in just three of the seven games in the Houston series, hit 8 of 11 shots in an 18-point, eye-opening performance. Trayce Jackson-Davis, who left the bench for just 24 minutes against the Rockets, chipped in with 15 points and six rebounds. \"There's no Steph. It's a completely different team,\" Kerr assured Friday when asked if he had rotation changes in mind for Game 3. \"Everything has to be about finding a new formula, and JK (Kuminga) is absolutely a part of that formula.\" Continuing the thought, he added, \"(Jackson-Davis) showed he can be effective against this team.\" Golden State's new look hardly impacted the Timberwolves, who rode big nights from Julius Randle (24 points, 11 assists) and Nickeil Alexander-Walker (20 point) to the one-sided win. Make no mistake, Minnesota coach Chris Finch insisted afterward, the best thing that happened all night was when star Anthony Edwards, who went to the locker room after suffering an injury to his left ankle in the second quarter, returned to the lineup after halftime. \"There's lots of ways being an elite athlete pays off,\" he noted. \"Being able to shake those things off certainly is one of them. I was really planning on not seeing him the rest of the game.\" Edwards was not listed on the Timberwolves' injury report posted Friday. --Field Level Media",

    "content": "May 10 - Addison Barger hit three doubles, drove in two runs and made one of Toronto's several sterling defensive plays as the Blue Jays defeated the host Seattle Mariners 6-3 on Friday in the opener of a three-game series. Nathan Lukes homered for the Blue Jays, who won their second straight following a four-game skid. Blue Jays starter Kevin Gausman (3-3) allowed three runs on seven hits over 5 1/3 innings, with no walks and three strikeouts. Jeff Hoffman struck out three in the ninth for his eighth save. The Blue Jays scored twice in the first inning and three more times in the third off Luis Castillo (3-3) to take a 5-0 lead. Bo Bichette and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. drew walks to open the first, and George Springer reached on an infield single to load the bases with one out. Barger, who was born in the Seattle suburb of Bellevue, Wash., then lined a double to right to make it 2-0. With two outs in the third, Barger doubled to center and scored on Ernie Clement's single to right. Lukes went deep to right-center to extend the lead to 5-0. The Mariners got a run back in the bottom of the inning, as Ben Williamson and J.P. Crawford singled with two outs and Jorge Polanco followed with an RBI hit. Julio Rodriguez then scorched a 111 mph liner down the third base line, but Barger made a leaping catch to end the inning. Bichette, Toronto's shortstop, made a pair of leaping catches to prevent hits, and center fielder Daulton Varsho robbed Williamson of a home run in the fifth at the wall in right-center. The Mariners scored twice in the sixth to make it 5-3. With one out, Rodriguez, Cal Raleigh and Randy Arozarena all singled, the latter bringing home Rodriguez from second and ending Gausman's night. Reliever Brendon Little struck out pinch hitter Donovan Solano before Leody Taveras lined a run-scoring double to left. Seattle threatened in the eighth against Yimi Garcia as Rodriguez led off with a single and Raleigh and Arozarena walked to load the bases with no outs. Pinch hitter Miles Mastrobuoni hit a liner that first baseman Guerrero knocked down before throwing to the plate for a forceout. Garcia then fanned Taveras and Dylan Moore to get out of the jam. The Blue Jays added an insurance run in the ninth as they loaded the bases on a single by Tyler Heineman, a one-out walk to Bichette and a single by Guerrero. Varsho hit a sacrifice fly to left to make it 6-3. Castillo gave up five runs on seven hits in five innings. The right-hander walked two and fanned three. --Field Level Media",

Nikola Jokic missed all 10 of his 3-point attempts and finished 8-for-25 from the field but ended the night with 20 points and 16 rebounds for the Nuggets, who lead the best-of-seven series 2-1. Game 4 is Sunday afternoon in Denver. Aaron Gordon scored 22 points, including a tying bucket in the final minute of regulation, and Michael Porter Jr. went 5-for-6 from deep and finished with 21 points for the Nuggets, who finished 39-for-85 from the field (45.9 percent). \"We've been in this situation before, we stayed poised,\" Porter said about Denver's ability to win close games. \"(Aaron Gordon) hit that big 3 to send it to overtime, like he's done all playoffs. Huge win.\" Jalen Williams scored 32 points for Oklahoma City, which was 1-for-7 from the field in overtime with two turnovers. Chet Holmgren had 18 points and 16 rebounds, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander finished with 18 points and 13 rebounds and Isaiah Hartenstein had 10 points and 10 rebounds for the Thunder, who were 40-for-104 (38.5 percent) from the field. \"One thing that it takes to be a great team is you get taken to the limit in the playoffs, and you've got to rise to the challenges that you're confronted with,\" Thunder head coach Mark Daigneault said. \"This team's made a habit of doing that repeatedly. I have full confidence we'll continue to do that, but we have to embrace what this is.\" Jokic opened overtime with a layup and Porter drained a 3-pointer to make it 107-102. Williams missed a floater and had a turnover, which led to Murray's layup with 3:02 left. Holmgren's dunk with 1:56 left was Oklahoma City's only basket in overtime, and the Nuggets closed it out. \"I think late in the games, you can rely on what you've seen and felt and done,\" Nuggets interim head coach David Adelman said about the team's playoff experience. \"You can feel a game that maybe you played a couple of years ago.\" Gilgeous-Alexander went 7-for-22 from the field but put the Thunder ahead 93-92 with his first 3-pointer of the night with 7:33 left in the fourth. Oklahoma City led 95-93 after Murray split a pair of free throws with 5:58 left, and both teams went cold from the field. Gilgeous-Alexander missed three straight shots and Denver tied it on Gordon's two free throws with 4:26 remaining. Williams hit a layup and Murray tied it at 97 with two free throws and put Denver ahead with a 17-footer with 2:17 left. Luguentz Dort gave Oklahoma City back in front with a 3-pointer -- his only points of the night -- Murray was called for a travel with 1:31 remaining and Williams made a pair of free throws to make it 102-99. Gordon's 3-pointer tied it with 27.5 seconds left, Gilgeous-Alexander missed a floater and Jokic's 20-footer at the buzzer was off, sending it to overtime. --Field Level Media",

    "content": "May 10 - Tomoyuki Sugano threw 7 1/3 impressive innings, Gunnar Henderson homered and hit an RBI triple and the Baltimore Orioles ended a five-game losing streak with a 4-1 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Friday night in Anaheim, Calif. Sugano (4-2), who played 12 seasons in Japan before signing a one-year, $13 million contract with the Orioles, pitched his best game in the majors. He allowed one run and three hits while striking out five without walking a batter in the opener of a three-game series. The Angels' only run came across in the seventh when Yoan Moncado tripled and scored on a groundout by Taylor Ward. Sugano got help from his bullpen, particularly Yennier Cano and Keegan Akin in the eighth. The Angels trailed 3-1 and had two on with one out and Zach Neto at the plate. Neto fouled off seven consecutive pitches from Cano with a full count, then finally struck out swinging on the 13th pitch. Akin entered and got Nolan Schanuel to fly out to end the inning, and Felix Bautista pitched a 1-2-3 ninth for his seventh save. Angels starter Kyle Hendricks (1-4) was coming off his longest outing since the 2023 season, but he found trouble immediately against the Orioles. Henderson homered with two outs in the first inning, his fourth of the season, and the Orioles added two runs in the second. Hendricks walked the first two batters of the latter inning before yielding an RBI single to Jackson Holliday. One out later, Emmanuel Rivera added an RBI single to increase the lead to 3-0. Hendricks settled in, keeping Baltimore off the scoreboard in the third, fourth and fifth innings. But in the sixth, the first two Orioles reached base on singles, spelling his departure. Angels reliever Reid Detmers, coming off three outings in which he allowed 12 runs and recorded only one out, retired the next three hitters in succession to end the threat. After the Angels cut their deficit to 3-1 in the seventh, Henderson's two-out RBI triple in the ninth boosted Baltimore's advantage. --Field Level Media",

The contract for a new cloud-based HR platform,signed on May 2and awarded without seeking bids from rivals, had raised eyebrows among current and former employees of the Office of Personnel Management. They had described the sole-source contract as irregular, given the competition in an industry that includes ADP and SAP(SAPG.DE), opens new tab, and expressed surprise to see OPM's largely successful in-house HR platform on track to be replaced. On Friday, a federal contracting website page about the award was updated to state that the award opportunity was canceled, without elaborating. OPM and Workday did not respond to requests for comment. OPM said earlier this month that the sole-source award was necessary due to \"operational failures\" and federal mandates that required immediate action. The Workday project, while small at $342,200, had the potential to set the stage for a much larger award, since many federal agencies rely on the OPM HR platforms that the new project sought to replace. The award drew criticism as running counter to the mission of the Department of Government Efficiency, which was set up by Musk to make the government more efficient by firing workers and cancelling contracts as well as by cracking down on waste and abuse. \"This procurement undermined the integrity of DOGE, who was supposed to root out fraud waste and abuse,\" said John Weiler, director of the Information Technology Acquisition Advisory Council, a government-chartered nonprofit group that makes recommendations to improve federal IT contracting. \"This was a blatant disregard of the rule of law,\" he added, citing federal contracting law and regulations.",

Los Angeles overcame a three-run deficit after squandering a five-run lead. Ohtani hit a 1-2 pitch from Ryan Thompson with one out to break a tie at 11-11. Earlier in the inning, Andy Pages and Enrique Hernandez had RBI doubles and Max Muncy tied the game with an RBI single off Kevin Ginkel (0-1), who gave up four straight hits to open the ninth. Lourdes Gurriel Jr. had a grand slam and five RBIs, Ketel Marte homered twice and Eugenio Suarez and Randal Grichuk also went deep for the D-backs in the slugfest, which featured seven homers and 14 extra-base hits. Ohtani added two doubles and four RBIs and Hernandez had a homer, three hits and three runs for the Dodgers, who earned their major-league-leading 14th comeback victory.

Paddack (1-3), who hadn't pitched more than five innings in any of his previous seven starts this season, retired the first 17 Giants he faced before Christian Koss, the No. 9 hitter, singled to center field with two outs in the sixth. Paddack lost his shutout bid when Matt Chapman hit a solo shot in the seventh.

He finished with six strikeouts and no walks in his longest outing since going eight full innings in a no-decision at Cleveland last May. Facing the potential tying run at the plate, Louis Varland retired both batters he faced in the eighth to preserve a 3-1 lead. Danny Coulombe recorded his second save of the season with a 1-2-3 ninth. The Twins wasted no time giving Paddack a lead. Buxton smacked Jordan Hicks' first pitch of the game for a triple. Two pitches later, Minnesota went up 1-0 on an RBI single by Trevor Larnach. A two-out RBI single by Carlos Correa made it 2-0 in the fourth, scoring Ty France from second base. Buxton helped produce Minnesota's third run when his single in the fifth was misplayed by Ramos in left field, allowing Harrison Bader to score. Hicks (1-4) completed six innings, during which he allowed all three Minnesota runs and seven hits. Like Paddack, he struck out six without issuing a walk. Buxton and Correa had two hits apiece for the Twins, whose lone extra-base hit was Buxton's game-opening triple.

    "title": "Explosions reported after India and Pakistan agree to ceasefire",
    "content": "ISLAMABAD/NEW DELHI, May 10 (Reuters) - Nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan agreed to a ceasefire on Saturday afterU.S. pressureand four days of fighting, but within hours explosions rang out in border cities and towns and India accused Pakistan of violating the pact. Artillery fire and attack drones were witnessed in Jammu and Kashmir, the centre of much of the fighting, while blasts from air-defence systems boomed in cities under blackout, similar to the previous evening, according to authorities, residents and Reuters witnesses. Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri told reporters that Pakistan had violated the understanding arrived at by the two countries earlier in the day, and that the Indian armed forces had been instructed to \"deal strongly\" with any repetition. \"We call upon Pakistan to take appropriate steps to address these violations and deal with the situation with seriousness and responsibility,\" Misri told a media briefing. In response, the foreign ministry of Pakistan said the country was committed to the ceasefire and blamed India for the violations. \"Our forces are handling the situation with responsibility and restraint,\" it said. The ministry also called on troops on the ground to exercise restraint and said that any issues in the implementation of the ceasefire should be addressed through communication at appropriate levels. Pakistan's military spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The fighting has been the worst between the old South Asian enemies in nearly three decades and threatened to erupt into a full-scale war in one of the world's most volatile and densely populated regions. There were briefly fears that nuclear arsenals might come into play as Pakistan's military said a top body overseeing its nuclear weapons would meet. But the defence minister said no such meeting was scheduled, hours after a night of heavy fighting in which the two countries targeted each other’s military bases and the combined civilian death toll rose to 66. \"Pakistan and India have agreed to a ceasefire with immediate effect,\" Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar posted on X. \"Pakistan has always strived for peace and security in the region, without compromising on its sovereignty and territorial integrity!\" Misri had earlier said the chiefs of the two countries' military operations had spoken to each other and agreed that all fighting would stop at 5 p.m. Indian time (1130 GMT). U.S. PresidentDonald Trumpposted: \"After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence.\" Dar told the broadcaster Geo News that military channels and hotlines between India and Pakistan had been activated, and three dozen countries had helped to facilitate the agreement. On Wednesday, India had attacked what it said was \"terrorist infrastructure\" in Pakistani Kashmir and Pakistan, two weeks after 26 people were killed in an attack on Hindu tourists in Indian Kashmir. Pakistan denied India's accusations that it was involved in the attack. Days of cross-border fire, shelling and drone and missile attacks followed. Despite the truce, two Indian government sources told Reuters that the punitive measures announced by India and reciprocated by Pakistan, such as trade suspension and visa cancellations, would remain in place for now. The sources also said the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, a critical water-sharing pact that India suspended after the Kashmir attack,would remain suspended. The Indian foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that he and Vice President JD Vance had engaged with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Pakistan's Shehbaz Sharif, Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, Pakistan's army chief Asim Munir, and the two national security advisers over the course of 48 hours. In a post on X, Rubio commended Modi and Sharif on the agreement, which he said included not only an immediate ceasefire but also the start of talks on \"a broad set of issues at a neutral site.” News of the ceasefire was greeted with relief on both sides of the border and Pakistan's airport authority said its airspace had been fully reopened. But the subsequent violations sparked alarm in India. \"What the hell just happened to the ceasefire? Explosions heard across Srinagar!!!\", Omar Abdullah, chief minister of Indian Kashmir, posted on X. \"This is no ceasefire. The air defence units in the middle of Srinagar just opened up.\" India and Pakistan have been locked in adispute over Kashmirever since they were born at the end of British colonial rule in 1947. Hindu-majority India and Muslim Pakistan both rule part of Kashmir but claim it in full. They have gone to war three times, including twice over Kashmir, alongside numerous smalleroutbreaks of fighting. India blames Pakistan for an insurgency in its part of Kashmir that began in 1989 and has killed tens of thousands. It also blames Pakistani Islamist militant groups for attacks elsewhere in India. Pakistan rejects both charges. It says it provides only moral, political and diplomatic support to Kashmiri separatists.",

The Federal Aviation Administration said the telecommunications outage impacted communications and radar displays at Philadelphia Terminal Radar Approach Control that guides aircraft in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey around 3:55 a.m. ET on Friday and lasted about 90 seconds. The agency said late on Friday it plans to meet with major airlines on Wednesdayabout potential temporary cutsin flights at Newark Liberty to address recent major disruptions due to equipment and staffing issues. The latest incident highlights the air traffic control network's aging infrastructure and comes a day after Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy proposed spending billions of dollars to fix it over the next three to four years. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said there was \"a glitch in the system\" caused by the same telecom issue that caused the prior incident. She said the goal is to address the technical issue later on Friday \"to prevent further issues.\" Air traffic control audio recordings and flight records suggested there had been another brief Friday outage within 20 minutes of the 3:55 a.m. event. The FAA did not reply to request for comment on that. A recording of an exchange obtained by Reuters discussed the 3:55 a.m. outage with a pilot. \"FedEx 1989, I’m going to hand you off here, our scopes just went black again,\" the controller told the pilot. \"If you care about this, contact your airline and try to get some pressure for them to fix this stuff.\" The pilot responded he was sorry to hear of the outage. FedEx said the plane made it safely from Newark to Boston without any issue. \"We appreciate the professionalism and actions of our crew members and the controllers in safely addressing this challenging situation,\" the company said in a statement. A little while later, the controller told a Flexjet flight that the tower \"just had another brief radar outage.\" The airplane continued into nearby Teterboro, according to FlightRadar24. The FAA said on Wednesday it was taking immediate steps to address ongoing problems that have disrupted hundreds of flights at Newark since April 28, especially of United Airlines(UAL.O), opens new tab, the largest carrier at the airport located just outside New York City. United said on Friday the FAA outage impacted its Newark operation but did not elaborate. It hassharply cut flightsand wants the FAA toimpose new limitations on Newark flightsto address ongoing delays. \"Decades of failing to properly invest in the system has prevented good-faith efforts to make technology upgrades and bolster the staffing of our nation’s hard-working air traffic controllers,\" United CEO Scott Kirby said in a Fox News op-ed on Friday. The FAA said it is increasing air traffic controller staffing, adding three new, high-bandwidth telecommunications connections and deploying a temporary backup system to the Philadelphia TRACON during the switch to a more reliable fiber-optic network. Duffy said on Thursday that the FAA had two redundant lines and \"both are up and working now\" at Philadelphia. The FAA did not immediately answer why the backup did not prevent Friday's incident. Lawmakers demanded action. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said on Friday the connection between New York air space and the Philadelphia air traffic control center must be fixed now. \"This cannot happen again,\" he said. U.S. Representative Rick Larsen, top Democrat on the committee overseeing the FAA, said the safety of the traveling public cannot continue being put at risk. \"Problems with our system have crossed Administrations, but safety improvements cannot span generations. We need action now,\" he said. Newark Airport has also been hit by runway construction, FAA equipment outages and air traffic control staffing shortages that prompted urgent calls from lawmakers for investigations and new funding. FlightAware said there were 380 flights delayed and 141 canceled. Between April 24 and May 7, nearly half of the more than 13,000 flights in and out of Newark were delayed or cancelled, more than double the rates at major airports in the vicinity such as LaGuardia and JFK, according to the flight tracking company. Duffy said on Thursday controllers overseeing planes at the busy airport lost contact with aircraft on April 28 for 30 to 90 seconds, an incident that raised serious alarm. The FAA last year relocated control of the Newark airspace to Philadelphia to address staffing and congested New York City area traffic.",

    "title": "Connor Hellebuyck, Jets blank Stars, level series 1-1",
    "content": "May 10 - Connor Hellebuyck made 21 saves to help the Winnipeg Jets even their Western Conference semifinal series against the visiting Dallas Stars with a 4-0 win in Game 2 on Friday night. Hellebuyck, the front-runner to win a third Vezina Trophy as the NHL's top goalie, has 49 shutouts in his career, including four in the postseason. \"That's what he does every night for us,\" Jets defenseman Josh Morrissey said of Hellebuyck. \"He's an incredible goaltender. He makes very difficult saves look very easy, routinely and often. You could tell he was feeling it tonight and when he's feeling it like that, it gives the players in front of him, defensemen, forwards, a lot of confidence.\" Game 3 in the best-of-seven series is scheduled for Sunday afternoon in Dallas. \"It's a game we can build off of,\" Morrissey said. \"There were a lot of good things out there. As everybody knows, momentum in the playoffs is in-game. I don't think it often carries over from game to game. So, we'll try to look at things we did well today. It will be a whole different animal going on the road here, but definitely a lot we can build on.\" Nikolaj Ehlers had two goals and an assist, Gabriel Vilardi and Adam Lowry also scored and Dylan DeMelo contributed two assists for the Jets, who won the Presidents' Trophy for the best record during the regular season. Jake Oettinger turned aside 21 shots for the Stars, who were coming off a 3-2 road victory in Game 1 on Wednesday. Tyler Seguin was called for a double-minor high-sticking penalty on Morrissey 17 seconds into the game, and Vilardi scored with 42 seconds left on the four-minor power play to give the Jets a 1-0 lead. Ehlers took a shot that clipped off Oettinger's skate, hit the post, came back and hit Oettinger's skate blade and was heading back toward the goal line when Vilardi pushed it across. Morrissey had missed Game 1 after sustaining an upper-body injury in Game 7 against the St. Louis Blues on Sunday. The Jets scored again when a centering pass by Ehlers went off the skate of Dallas defenseman Esa Lindell and redirected into his own net, giving Winnipeg a 2-0 lead at 7:07 of the first. \"You start the game with a four-minute minor 10 seconds in,\" Dallas coach Peter DeBoer said. \"They score on the power play and then one goes off our own skate and into the net. You're down 2-0 (7:07 into the game). That's a big hole in this rink. So, self-inflicted, the other kind of unlucky.\" The Jets extended the lead to 3-0 at 11:02 of the second. A shot from the right point by DeMelo was deflected wide and caromed off the end boards and out the other side. Lowry was there to sweep the puck into the net from the bottom of the left circle before Oettinger could slide over. Hellebuyck made two more Grade-A saves in the second period, a sprawling stop on Evgenii Dadonov at 14:16, followed by a left pad save on Jamie Benn off a rush at 15:32. \"I thought we pushed hard in the second to try and climb back in the game,\" DeBoer said. \"Hellebuyck made some saves. We get one there, maybe the momentum shifts, but that was the game.\" Hellebuyck led the NHL in wins (47), goals-against average (2.00) and shutouts (eight) during the regular season, and was second in save percentage (.925). However, he had struggled in the playoffs entering Game 2, owning a 4-4 mark, a 3.75 GAA and a .836 save percentage Ehlers scored into an empty net with 3:40 left to make it 4-0. --Field Level Media",

    "title": "Royals outlast Red Sox in 12th for 7th straight win",
    "content": "May 10 - Freddy Fermin roped an RBI single in the 12th inning, after Kansas City's Michael Lorenzen and Boston's Hunter Dobbins both delivered stellar starts, and the Royals recorded a season-high seventh straight win, 2-1 on Friday night. After Cavan Biggio's sacrifice bunt moved placement runner Michael Massey to third, Fermin dropped a Sean Newcomb pitch into left field to send the Royals to their 16th win in 18 games. Lorenzen allowed just three hits and struck out seven without a walk through seven innings. Meanwhile, in his fourth major league start, the rookie Dobbins lowered his ERA to 2.78 after giving up five hits and fanning six, also without issuing a walk, over six innings. The teams combined for just 14 hits. Boston scored the game's first run in the 11th, when Rafael Devers' grounder stopped by Royals shortstop Bobby Witt Jr. allowed placement runner Ceddanne Rafaela to score from third. Devers, who also singled, came through one day after he told reporters he would not oblige the team's request for him to play first base. Having already rather unhappily moved from third base to designated hitter this season after Boston acquired Alex Bregman, Devers met with club owner John Henry about this situation. Kansas City, though, tied it via Vinnie Pasquantino's RBI single in the bottom of the 11th. As Dobbins and Lorenzen continued to duel on the mound, Kansas City posted the first real scoring threat in the bottom of the fifth. Kyle Isbel tripled with one out in the frame, but then was thrown out between third base and home on a ground ball to shortstop by Jonathan India, who was also thrown out trying to take second on the play. In the top of the sixth, Boston wasted a leadoff double from Rafaela. Kansas City threatened again in the seventh when Greg Weissert walked the first two batters of the inning. But Mark Canha then hit into a 6-3 double play and Fermin was out on a liner to right fielder Wilyer Abreu. Steven Cruz (1-0) relieved Daniel Lynch IV in the 12th and got two outs for his first career win. --Field Level Media",

    "title": "Brad Marchand shows off OT wizardry as Panthers down Leafs",
    "content": "May 10 - Brad Marchand scored 15:27 into overtime as the Florida Panthers defeated the Maple Leafs 5-4 on Friday night in Sunrise, Fla., slicing Toronto's lead in the Eastern Conference semifinal series to 2-1. Marchand produced his fourth career overtime playoff goal when his shot bounced in off the body of Toronto's Morgan Rielly. That number is tied for the fourth most among active players, trailing only Corey Perry, Patrick Kane and teammate Carter Verhaeghe (five apiece). Teammate Sam Reinhart said of Marchand, \"He's tenacious. Players like that shine at this time of the year.\" Game 4 in the best-of-seven series is set for Sunday night in Sunrise. Reinhart and Verhaeghe each had a goal and an assist and Aleksander Barkov and Jonah Gadjovich also scored for the Panthers, who are the reigning Stanley Cup champions. Evan Rodrigues added two assists from the Panthers, who got 27 saves from Sergei Bobrovsky. John Tavares scored twice, Matthew Knies logged a goal and an assist and Rielly also tallied for the Leafs, who blew a 3-1 second-period lead. Toronto's Mitch Marner, Auston Matthews and William Nylander each had two assists, and Joseph Woll stopped 31 shots. Florida scored two of its goals -- including the game-winner -- off either Rielly's body or stick. \"That's how pucks are going in right now,\" Rielly said, \"and it's not just in this series.\" Toronto scored just 23 seconds into the game. Marner's shot clanged off the crossbar, and Knies spun away from Panthers defenseman Aaron Ekblad before hitting the open left side of the net. The Leafs made it 2-0 on Tavares' wraparound goal with 14:03 left in the first. Florida got on the board on an own goal with 12:22 remaining in the first. Reinhart dished to Barkov, who made a move and lost his edge as he drove to the net. The puck then tipped in off the stick of Rielly. Toronto got its power play going with 17:08 left in the second. Marner's shot found Tavares' stick, and that deflection bounced in off the body of Panthers defenseman Gustav Forsling. However, the Panthers scored two goals in the next three minutes, tying the score 3-3. First, Reinhart scored on a scramble in front at 4:13 despite the efforts of Leafs defenseman Brandon Carlo, who had half a stick and still tried to keep the puck from trickling past the line. Then, Matthew Tkachuk jarred the puck loose on a forecheck. Sam Bennett threaded a backward pass between sliding defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson and Woll. Verhaeghe had the easy job, tapping the puck into the open net at 5:17. Gadjovich, off the rush, then gave Florida a 4-3 lead with a tip-in shot at 15:07 of the second. Toronto tied the score 4-4 with 9:04 left in the third. Rielly's shot from the right wing was stopped by Bobrovsky, but the puck bounced in off the right leg of Panthers defenseman Seth Jones. --Field Level Media",

    "content": "May 10 - Gavin Sheets knocked in four runs, Martin Maldonado launched a homer and the visiting San Diego Padres became the latest team to batter the Colorado Rockies' pitching staff during a 13-9 victory in Denver on Friday night. Sheets' three-run double capped a four-run third inning that gave San Diego a 5-0 lead, and he added an RBI double during a five-run fifth. Maldonado finished off the fifth with a two-run homer to left, his second of the year, in the opener of a three-game set. Randy Vasquez (2-3) earned his first win since April 9, allowing six hits and two runs in six innings with a walk and a season-high five strikeouts. It was Vasquez's longest outing since firing six scoreless innings in a March 29 no-decision against Atlanta. Antonio Senzatela (1-6) suffered the loss after giving up nine hits and eight runs (four earned) over 4 2/3 innings. Senzatela walked two and fanned two as Colorado fell to 6-32 with its seventh straight loss. Manny Machado initiated scoring for the Padres in the first with an RBI single to center. Jackson Merrill, who finished with three hits and two RBIs, lined a run-scoring double off the left field wall in the third before Sheets' bases-loaded double. Michael Toglia got the Rockies on the board with a solo homer in the fourth but the Padres established a 10-1 advantage in the fifth. Machado scored on one of Colorado's three errors, followed by Sheets' RBI double, Jason Heyward's run-scoring double and Maldonado's homer. Merrill tacked on an RBI single in the sixth and Xander Bogaerts added a sacrifice fly to make it 12-1. Jake Cronenworth finished San Diego's scoring in the eighth via a run-scoring single. The Rockies erased most of the deficit with a late offensive burst that included solo blasts from Ryan McMahon and Jordan Beck, as well as a five-run eighth. They added two more in the ninth and made the Padres use closer Robert Suarez for the last two outs, resulting in his 15th save. Machado and Luis Arraez each finished with three hits for San Diego. McMahon and Hunter Goodman collected three hits apiece for Colorado, which also got a two-run double from Kyle Farmer. --Field Level Media",

    "content": "May 10 - The host New York Mets hit four solo home runs and Clay Holmes gave up just one run in six innings en route to a 7-2 win over the Chicago Cubs on Friday. The Cubs lead the majors in runs scored, but it was the Mets who were teeing off in the opener of a three-game series. Jameson Taillon, who had held left-handed batters to a .161 average coming into the game, gave up homers to left-handed-hitting Francisco Lindor, Brett Baty, Jeff McNeil and Juan Soto in the first four innings. It was the first time in his career that the right-hander served up four home runs. Taillon (2-2) threw 100 pitches in four innings, permitting six runs, five earned, on nine hits and one walk. He struck out four. Holmes (5-1) gave up just three hits and three walks while striking out five. The right-hander, who served as the New York Yankees' closer last year, threw 93 pitches and lowered his ERA to 2.74. The Mets have won seven straight games started by Holmes, who gave up a solo home run to Kyle Tucker in the fourth inning. It was the first home run Holmes allowed in a Mets uniform, after 39 2/3 innings. In addition to the homers, New York scored two runs in the third inning without hitting the ball out of the infield. Brandon Nimmo walked with one out, and Francisco Alvarez singled up the middle when second baseman Nico Hoerner could not make the play. Baty then hit a slow roller to short that he beat out. Luisangel Acuna followed with a roller to Dansby Swanson at short. Swanson stepped on second but launched his throw to first far over Michael Busch's head. Instead of an inning-ending double play, Alvarez and Baty scored for a 5-0 Mets lead. Lindor's leadoff home run in the first inning was his eighth long ball of the season. Busch hit his seventh home run in the ninth for the other Cubs' run as Chicago lost a third straight game for the first time this season. The Mets have won three of their past four. --Field Level Media",

The Neeraj Chopra Classic on May 24, a World Athletics Gold category meet, was set to feature a host of international names including Anderson Peters, Julius Yego, Thomas Roehler and Curtis Thompson. Chopra's move came after cricket-mad India and Pakistansuspendedtheir elite Twenty20 leagues on Friday in the wake of the ongoingconflictbetween the nuclear-armed neighbours. \"This decision has been made after careful thought and consultation, with the wellbeing of athletes, stakeholders, and the broader community as the top priority,\" Chopra's team announced on social media on Friday. \"We believe in the unifying power of sport. But, in this critical moment, standing firm with the nation matters most. All our gratitude and thoughts at this point are only with our Armed Forces, who are at the forefront for our nation.\" Chopra said late last month it was \"completely out of the question\" that rival and Paris Olympics gold medallist Arshad Nadeem of Pakistan would attend the meet following a deadly Islamist militant attack in Indian Kashmir. The two countries have clashed since India struck multiple locations in Pakistan on Wednesday that it said were \"terrorist camps\" in retaliation for the attack in Kashmir, in which it said Islamabad was involved. Pakistan denied the accusation but both countries have exchanged cross-border firing and shelling and sent drones and missiles into each other's airspace since then, with dozens of people dying in the violence.

    "title": "Unhappy at 1B notion, Red Sox's Rafael Devers meets with owner",
    "content": "May 10 - After meeting with Boston Red Sox principal owner John Henry, Rafael Devers remained at designated hitter for Friday night's road game against the Kansas City Royals. Devers, a three-time All-Star at third base, already lost that spot on the field when the Red Sox signed Alex Bregman to a three-year contract in February. The nine-year veteran was vocal this week about not wanting to take over at first base, at least not full time. Devers met with Henry and manager Alex Cora before the game. Boston's chief baseball officer, Craig Breslow, who joined team president Sam Kennedy and Henry on the trip to Kansas City, said Henry \"seems to have had a productive conversation (with Devers), and that's where it is at right now.\" Cora also called it \"a good conversation,\" although he said no decision was made about Devers' position going forward. Devers \"expressed his feelings. John did the same. I think everybody saw who was here, so I think that carries weight in the clubhouse,\" Cora said. The first base vacancy arose when Triston Casas went down with a season-ending injury to his left knee on May 2. Devers said on Thursday that the Red Sox floated the idea of him moving to first shortly after Casas' injury. He said the team \"can't expect me to play every single position out there.\" Devers, who has played exclusively at DH this season, started the season slowly at the plate, going 0-for-19 with 15 strikeouts before breaking into the hit column in his sixth game. He has rebounded of late, hitting .365 in his last 13 games to raise his batting average to .253. He went 1-for-5 and drove in Boston's only run in a 2-1 loss to the Royals in 12 innings on Friday. Devers has a career batting average of .278. In his nine seasons in the majors, he has 206 home runs and 664 RBIs. --Field Level Media",

    "title": "WNBA notebook: Liberty, Dream blending in new faces, schemes",
    "content": "May 10 - The New York Liberty team that walked off the court last fall with the franchise's first-ever WNBA championship has made some slight adjustments to the roster. Stars Breanna Stewart, Jonquel Jones and Sabrina Ionescu are back. Courtney Vandersloot left in free agency, and Kayla Thornton was lost in the expansion draft. But the team made one huge roster change with the addition of guard Natasha Cloud, a stalwart defender whom New York had tried to trade for through the years, head coach Sandy Brondello said Friday. It finally happened in March when the Connecticut Sun -- who had acquired her from Phoenix the month prior -- sent the 33-year-old to New York for first-round draft picks in 2025 and ‘26. And Cloud, a first-team All-Defensive Team selection in 2022 and a 2019 WNBA champion with the Washington Mystics, is embracing her new role. \"I'm going to continue to study,\" she said, per the New York Daily News. \"I don't want to only know what my position is. I want to know where everyone's supposed to be on the board, the nuances of offense, the options too. \"And once I retain that, I'll be better handling offense, too. So that's my main goal right now, is just being able to run our offense with fluidity and knowing it like the back of my hand.\" The Liberty open the regular season May 17 at home against the Las Vegas Aces. --In Atlanta, Brittney Griner is opening her first season with the Dream after 11 with the Phoenix Mercury. And she's being tasked by first-year head coach Karl Smesko to move beyond her traditional center position. Seems you can teach veteran post players some new tricks. The Dream signed the 6-foot-9 Griner and 6-foot-3 Brionna Jones as free agents in the offseason, putting two longtime competitors and All-Star centers on the same roster. They are venturing away from the post. \"Either one of us, we can interchange, pop in, or going down low,\" Griner said on a team video call. \"The other team, you've got to pick your poison. Definitely don't want to be them. Yeah, this is going to be a good partnership right here.\" Added Jones, \"It's a lot of fun to be able to have that other post player that I know I can dump it down to and play off of it.\" And if they see an open 3-point attempt, Smesko wants them to take it. Smesko knows just how he plans to integrate them into his guard-rich offense, even if success doesn't come overnight. \"I thought these two would work really well together,\" Smesko said. \"But I thought it would take a little bit of time to jell. They're just so smart and they're able to realize their advantages. They really pick things up quickly. They've only practiced together a few days and to be as far along and to make as many smart reads as they've been doing is really remarkable.\" Griner is grateful. \"Every day I'm just so glad I don't have to guard (Jones) anymore,\" Griner said. \"It's been amazing.\" --The Liberty's scheme won't look the same this season, either, as they've decided to do something similar to the Dream. Instead of an offense with a big in the paint and four players on the outside, the \"five-out\" will see some action this season, too. \"It's good,\" fourth-year center Nyara Sabally said, according to the New York Post. \"It's kind of the way the game is developing. If you look at other teams, if you look at NBA teams, that's kind of how the game has been developing, too. \"Especially in our team, I feel like we have a lot of bigs that can handle the ball that are outside. Our starting center (Jones) can shoot step-back 3s. So it's kind of like almost fits us really well.\" The 6-foot-5 Sabally said she is ready to move from the post to the outside when called to do so. \"For me, I feel like I've always been kind of more on the dynamic side. I like being on the perimeter and being able to drive and stuff, so I think it kind of just opens up the paint a lot,\" she said. \"Got to get used to actually shooting the 3 and being comfortable with that, but it's more so just being aware that there's a lot more space to operate with. It's a fast-paced offense. We want to run. We want to get out, so I think it's going to be a good fit.\" --There's one thing Kate Martin made clear about her role as a member of the expansion Golden State Valkyries, who will play their first-ever WNBA game on May 16 against the Los Angeles Sparks in San Francisco. She's grateful. Grateful to have spent her rookie season in 2024 with the Las Vegas Aces, where star A'ja Wilson took her under her wing. Grateful to have been selected in the expansion draft by the Valkyries. Grateful to have had nearly 17,500 fans in the crowd at Chase Center earlier this week to witness an 83-82 loss to the Sparks. \"When I got picked in the expansion draft it was just a very exciting moment,\" Martin said in an online news conference. \"As people know, this league is very competitive, so if you get another opportunity to come to a training camp and get to, you know, compete for a roster spot, it's a good day.\" Martin is accustomed to the spotlight after playing with Caitlin Clark at Iowa in college. She is expected to play a bigger role with the Valkyries than she did with the Aces. In 34 games (two starts), Martin averaged 2.6 points and 1.6 rebounds over 11.5 minutes per game. A month ago, the Valkyries became the first WNBA team to sell 10,000 season tickets, so they can expect to play before big crowds in their home arena all season. Against the Sparks, the Valkyries almost came back to win following a 14-point deficit. \"The crowd was electric,\" coach Natalie Nakase said. \"You could hear them, especially toward the end, when it got, you know, pretty close so it was nice to know that when we're down our crowd is still like beside us and they have our back.\" --The Washington Mystics are beginning a new era under new coach Sydney Johnson, hoping to move past a 14-26 record last year and start fresh after 12 seasons under Mike, and then Eric, Thibault as head coach. Washington will be looking to move past the first round of the playoffs for the first time since winning the WNBA title in 2019. They will be doing it without Georgia Amoore, selected in the first round of the WNBA draft. Amoore suffered an ACL injury in practice in late April and will be out for the season, Johnson said. Despite the injury, the coach said it is important for his team to play with \"joy\" throughout the season. \"We are about our business and we are not going to be an easy out in any way, shape or form,\" Johnson said. \"Having the freshness and enthusiasm and joy of the moment, seeing each other every day. ... It's really important that we hold this for 44 games.\" --Field Level Media",

The students were placed on interim suspension and will be prohibited from taking their final exams or entering campus except to access their dormitories, the university official said. Columbia also barred 33 other people from campus, including students from other colleges and alumni who took part in the protest, according to the official. \"When rules are violated and when our academic community is purposefully disrupted, that is a considered choice — one with real consequences,\" the Columbia official said. Scores of students were arrested after seizing part of the school's main library on Wednesday in one of the biggest pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campus since last year's wave of protests against Israel's war in Gaza. Officers of the New York Police Department were called to campus to quell the protest at the request of university officials. The demonstration came amid negotiations between Columbia's board of trustees and the Trump administration, which announced in March it was penalizing the university over previous pro-Palestinian protests bycanceling hundreds of millions of dollars in research grants. There was no immediate reaction to news of the suspensions from student activists representing the protesters. Organizers of Wednesday's demonstration repeated their long-standing demands that the university cease investing any of its $14.8 billion endowment in weapons makers and other companies that support Israel's military occupation of Palestinian territories.",

The producer price index (PPI) dropped 2.7% in April year-on-year, worse than a 2.5% decline in March but was less than economists' forecast for a 2.8% fall, National Bureau of Statistics data showed on Saturday. \"China still faces persistent deflationary pressure,\" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. \"The pressure may rise in coming months as exports will likely weaken.\" \"Even if China and the U.S. can make progress and cut tariffs in trade negotiations, tariffs are unlikely to go back to the level before April,\" Zhang added. \"More proactive fiscal policy is necessary to boost domestic demand and address the deflation problem.\" Consumer prices eased 0.1% last month from a year earlier, matching a 0.1% drop in March and the forecast in a Reuters poll. CPI was up 0.1% month-on-month versus a 0.4% fall in March and compared with economists' forecasts for no change in prices. Core inflation, excluding volatile food and fuel prices, stood at 0.5% in April from a year earlier, in line with the increase recorded in March. The Chinese government is implementing a wide range of measures tostimulate consumptionacross different sectors and last week announced a raft of stimulus measures, includinginterest rate cutsand a major injection of liquidity. As the trade war between the world's two largest economies weighs on exports, China'sretailgiants, including JD.com(9618.HK), opens new taband Alibaba-owned Freshippo(9988.HK), opens new tab, have initiated measures to help exporters pivot to the domestic market. That could further depress prices as business and consumer confidence remain subdued due to the uncertain outlook. Global investment banks, including Goldman Sachs, have lowered their GDP forecasts for China this year to below the official target of around 5%, attributing the downgrade to the damaging trade war.",

    "content": "May 10 - Donovan Mitchell scored 43 points to lift the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 126-104 victory over the Indiana Pacers in Game 3 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series on Friday in Indianapolis. The top-seeded Cavaliers outscored Indiana by a 34-13 margin in the second quarter en route to cutting their deficit to 2-1 in the best-of-seven series. Game 4 is Sunday in Indianapolis. Mitchell, who added nine rebounds, made 14 of 29 shots from the floor and 10 of 14 from the free-throw line. The six-time All-Star drained five 3-pointers on 13 attempts after entering the contest just 2-for-18 from beyond the arc. Cleveland's Max Strus collected 20 points and seven rebounds, Jarrett Allen had 19 and 12 and reigning Defensive Player of the Year Evan Mobley added 18 and 13, respectively, in his return from a one-game absence caused by a sprained left ankle. Darius Garland finished with just 10 points while being plagued by foul trouble. He was playing in his first game since April 23, having recovered from a toe injury. \"(We were) down 2-0,\" Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson said. \"It's kind of now or never. You're banged up and you're hurting. ... They had to test it today. They showed a lot of fortitude. We have one day of recovery here, so it's a quick turnaround and they can turn it around and be ready to go.\" Cleveland held a decisive 56-37 edge in rebounds, including an 18-4 advantage on the offensive end. Indiana's Bennedict Mathurin scored 23 points off the bench and Pascal Siakam added 18. Star Tyrese Haliburton was limited to just four points on 2-of-8 shooting for the fourth-seeded Pacers. Strus said on NBA.TV of the Cavaliers' work against Haliburton, \"Our team defense overall was fantastic. Everybody stepped up. It's easy when you have two 7-footers behind you. They make my life so much easier. I don't look out at the stat sheets and box scores. All I care about is who wins the game at the end of the day.\" Siakam made a basket on the interior to forge a 36-36 tie before Cleveland went on a 30-9 run to end the second quarter. Strus, Mitchell and Sam Merrill each made 3-pointers during that sequence. Andrew Nembhard drained consecutive 3-pointers to trim Indiana's deficit to 80-65 with 4:50 remaining of the third quarter. The Cavaliers, however, responded with a 9-0 run to bolster their cushion. Siakam sank a 3-pointer to bring the Pacers within 104-93 with 8:26 to play, but Cleveland went on a 19-5 run to seal the victory. Cleveland scored the first 11 points of the game and upped its advantage to 15 before Indiana responded by scoring 22 of the final 29 points to earn a 32-32 tie at the end of the first quarter. \"This was a very poor effort at the beginning of the game, through too many parts of the game,\" Indiana coach Rick Carlisle said. \"... Pretty clearly, I didn't have these guys ready for this. (Haliburton) had a rough game. I have to do more to get him in better positions to have better shots.\" --Field Level Media",

Arnold's appointment was announced on social media on Friday by the Iraq Football Association, which published photographs of the 61-year-old being welcomed in Baghdad by officials from the national body. \"We are delighted to announce Graham Arnold as the new head coach of the Iraq national team,\" the federation said in a post on Instagram. \"Welcome to the Lions of Mesopotamia!\" Arnold replacesJesus Casasat the helm after the Spaniard's departure in the wake of a 2-1 loss to Palestine in March during the third round of Asia's qualifiers for the 2026 World Cup.

    "content": "WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration must temporarily halt its sweeping government overhaul because Congress did not authorize it to carry out large-scale staffing cuts and the restructuring of agencies, a federal judge said on Friday. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco sided with a group of unions, non-profits and local governments, and blocked large-scale mass layoffs known as \"reductions in force\" for 14 days. \"As history demonstrates, the President may broadly restructure federal agencies only when authorized by Congress,\" said Illston. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The ruling is the broadest of its kind against the government overhaul that has been led by Elon Musk, the world's richest person who is also CEO of electric vehicle maker Tesla(TSLA.O), opens new tab. Dozens of lawsuits have challenged DOGE's work on various grounds including violating privacy laws and exceeding its authority, with mixed results. Trumpdirectedgovernment agencies in February to work with the Department of Government Efficiency to identify targets for mass layoffs as part of the administration's restructuring plans. Trump urged agencies to eliminate duplicative roles, unnecessary management layers, and non-critical jobs, while automating routine tasks, closing regional field offices and reducing the use of outside contractors. “The Trump administration’s unlawful attempt to reorganize the federal government has thrown agencies into chaos, disrupting critical services provided across our nation,\" said a statement from the coalition of plaintiffs. \"Each of us represents communities deeply invested in the efficiency of the federal government – laying off federal employees and reorganizing government functions haphazardly does not achieve that.” Illston scheduled a hearing for May 22 to consider a longer-lasting preliminary injunction. She said that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on merits of some of their claims in their lawsuit, which was filed on April 28 and alleged Trump exceeded his authority. It also alleged the Office of Management and Budget, DOGE and Office of Personnel Management exceeded their authority and violated administrative law. Illston said plaintiffs are likely to suffer irreparable harm without the temporary restraining order, which she said preserves the status quo. Illston said the plaintiffs submitted more than 1,000 pages of evidence and 62 sworn declarations and she highlighted some of the material. For example, she said the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and its Pittsburgh office, which researches health hazards facing mineworkers, had 221 of the department's 222 workers terminated, citing the union. She gave similar examples at local offices of Head Start, which supports early learning, the Farm Service Agency and the Social Security Administration. \"The Court here is not considering the potential loss of income of one individual employee, but the widespread termination of salaries and benefits for individuals, families, and communities,\" Illston wrote in her ruling.",

    "content": "May 10 - Hunter Brown posted his fourth scoreless start of the season and the host Houston Astros registered a 3-0 victory over the Cincinnati Reds on Friday in the opener of a three-game interleague series. The Astros snapped a nine-game losing streak to the Reds behind another strong start from Brown (6-1), who finished an out shy of recording his eighth quality start in as many appearances this season. Although he issued a season-high four walks in 5 2/3 innings, Brown surrendered only two hits and recorded a season-high-tying nine strikeouts for a fourth consecutive outing. Brown faced a batter with multiple runners on base only twice. He recorded a called third strike on Elly De La Cruz to close the top of the third inning with Santiago Espinal and Matt McLain, both of whom walked, on second and first base, respectively. With Espinal and TJ Friedl on base in the fifth, Brown induced McLain to fly out to center to snuff out the threat. Brown didn't survive the sixth when he issued a two-out walk to Gavin Lux with the bases empty. Brown tossed a season-high 101 pitches, including 59 for strikes, and leaned heavily on a four-seam fastball that touched 99 mph. He threw four additional pitches -- sinker, slider, changeup and knuckle curve -- to keep the Reds off balance. Reds right-hander Nick Martinez (1-4) proved relatively elusive over his six innings. He allowed a season-high 10 hits but did not issue a walk. Martinez posted five strikeouts and made the Astros claw for the three runs they tallied while he pitched. Martinez benefited from the Astros' faulty baserunning in the first when Jeremy Pena and Jose Altuve were erased after recording singles. Christian Walker hit a leadoff double in the second inning and Zach Dezenzo produced a two-out single to supply the Astros with a 1-0 lead. In the fifth, Brendan Rodgers doubled to open the frame, and Mauricio Dubon singled him to third. Pena followed with an RBI groundout before Isaac Paredes drove home Dubon with a double down the first base line. Altuve, Walker and Yainer Diaz produced two-hit games for the Astros, who won their second game in a row. Closer Josh Hader struck out three in the ninth to notch his ninth save. The Reds fell for the sixth time in seven games. --Field Level Media",

Walls took a 3-2 pitch well below the strike zone from loser Jared Koenig (2-1), who gave up two hits and walk in the inning to load the bases. The Rays snapped a three-game losing streak overall and a seven-game skid at home. Cole Sulser (1-1) got the win, despite giving up a run in the top of the eighth on Rhys Holkins' RBI single as the Brewers tied the game at 3-3. Kansas City rookie right-hander Eric Orze pitched around a two-out single in the ninth for his second save in as many chances. The Rays took a 3-2 lead in the sixth on an obstruction call against Milwaukee third baseman Caleb Durbin. With runners on first and third and one out, the runner on first, Junior Caminero, took off for second. Catcher William Contreras fired to second base, but Caminero retreated to first. The throw then went to third, and it appeared that Christopher Morel was picked off third. But the umpire ruled that Durbin blocked the base, and Morel was awarded home and Caminero second. Brewers' manager Pat Murphy was ejected for arguing the call. Tampa Bay's Brandon Lowe hit a solo home run in the bottom of the fourth to tie the game at 2-2. He hit an 0-1 fastball over the right-center field fence an estimated 405 feet for his fifth homer of the season.

United said it has historically flown 440 flights daily out of Newark, but after cutting flights earlier this spring due to the runway construction and the latest cuts, it is now down to 293. The FAA last yearrelocated control of the Newark airspaceto Philadelphia to address staffing and congested New York City area traffic.

Falter (2-3) struck out three and walked two on 89 pitches. But closer Dennis Santana nearly let the advantage slip away before locking down his fourth save. The Braves didn't have an extra-base hit until Eli White tripled off Santana to lead off the ninth. White scored two batters later on a sacrifice fly by Michael Harris II.

Triolo's homer was his first of the season, and it marked the first time since April 27 that the Pirates hit multiple home runs in a game. It was only the sixth game this season in which Pittsburgh hit more than one home run. Allen and Austin Riley each had two hits for the Braves, who lost for the second time in three games. --Field Level Media",

    "title": "Trailing 2-0, Golden Knights face uphill climb as they visit Oilers",
    "content": "May 10 - The Vegas Golden Knights are not yet in must-win territory, but they can ill afford another loss when they visit the Edmonton Oilers for Game 3 of their Western Conference semifinal series on Saturday. The Golden Knights are down 2-0 in the best-of-seven series, having dropped both games at home to start the set. \"Take the good, look at the bad, and be ready,\" Vegas captain Mark Stone said of his team's situation. \"We've got to win a game on Saturday night.\" Teams that win the first two games of a best-of-seven series when starting on the road own an all-time series record of 88-22 (.800) in Stanley Cup playoffs. The Golden Knights, who won the Pacific Division in the regular season, have a big trend to buck after dropping a back-and-forth 5-4 overtime clash on Thursday. Edmonton erased a deficit in an NHL-record sixth consecutive victory -- despite staking itself a 4-2 lead early in the third period, watching it dissolve and recovering with Leon Draisaitl's overtime winner. \"We were much better than in Game 1 and we're going to have to be better if we expect to win this series. Keep progressing in that direction,\" Vegas coach Bruce Cassidy said on Friday. \"When you go through a series, that pendulum can swing if you stay with it. That's the message.\" There was no update on the status of defenseman Brayden McNabb, who left the game in overtime after being tripped by Edmonton's Viktor Arvidsson and sent crashing into the boards. Vegas forward Nicolas Roy was spared a suspension after a hearing with the NHL Department of Player Safety over his cross-check to the face of Trent Frederic. Roy attempted to play the puck while it was airborne but made contact with Frederic's head instead, resulting in a laceration for the Oilers forward. Roy received a major penalty and game misconduct for the play in overtime. After his hearing Friday, he was fined $7,812.50 but not suspended. The Oilers are in the driver's seat to reach the conference final for the second consecutive year and third time in four seasons. However, they know how quickly a series can change. After all, they lost the first two games of their opening-round meeting with the Los Angeles Kings before rattling off four consecutive wins. Edmonton already feels fortunate to have claimed Thursday's clash. \"Not pretty at all,\" Oilers captain Connor McDavid said. He added: \"Not our group's best, but we found a way.\" In Edmonton's favor has been the team's depth. Unlike past playoff runs, including last year's trip to Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final, the Oilers are receiving offensive production throughout the lineup. Sure, the overtime winner was by Draisaitl and set up by McDavid -- a classic example of what Edmonton's dynamic duo can achieve when a game is on the line -- but the supporting cast has been a big part for a team that won by superior five-on-five play in the first two games of this series. \"The fact we lost the special teams battle in both games and came out with both wins, that's something I wouldn't have expected,\" Edmonton coach Kris Knoblauch said on Friday. Now to see whether the Oilers can gain a stranglehold on the series. \"We're just building and building our game,\" McDavid said. \"I feel like our best is still coming, and I'd hope to see it at home here. ... It means nothing if we're not ready to roll for Game 3.\" --Field Level Media",

Gabe Taylor, a former defensive back at Rice, will have a chance to make the team his brother played for from 2004-07 before he was shot by an intruder in his home and killed at age 24. Gabe Taylor's agency, Creed Sports and Entertainment, said in a Instagram post last week that he chose Washington over \"multiple offers.\" \"This decision is especially meaningful because growing up, Gabe dreamed of playing for this team,\" Creed's post said. \"Now he has the chance to make his mark, forge his own path, compete for a roster spot, and honor the memory of Sean. Gabe couldn't be more excited, focused, and ready for the opportunity.\" Gabe Taylor went undrafted after five seasons at Rice, where he racked up 10 interceptions (one returned for touchdown), 239 tackles, 4.0 sacks and six forced fumbles over 54 career games.

    "content": "May 10 - Tarik Skubal set down the first 15 batters he faced and recorded a season-high 12 strikeouts as the streaking Detroit Tigers edged the visiting Texas Rangers 2-1 on Friday night. Skubal (4-2) allowed one run on two hits in seven innings. His strikeout total was one shy of his career high. Will Vest notched his fourth save. Colt Keith had two hits, scored a run and drove in another for the Tigers, who have won five straight and eight of their last nine games. Dillon Dingler added an RBI double. Texas starter Patrick Corbin (2-2) gave up two runs and three hits while walking four and striking out three in seven innings. Sam Haggerty's RBI single accounted for the Rangers' run. Texas has lost 12 of its last 16 games. The Tigers took a 1-0 lead in the second. Spencer Torkelson drew a one-out walk and Keith hit into a fielder's choice. Dingler followed with a fly ball to left center that eluded a diving Wyatt Langford for a double as Keith scored from first base. After Skubal polished off the last two batters in the top of the fourth with strikeouts, the Tigers made it 2-0 in the bottom of the inning. Riley Greene had a leadoff walk and stole second with two outs. Keith then lined a single to center to score Greene. Skubal nearly struck out the side in the fifth. After fanning Adolis Garcia, home plate umpire Malachi Moore called a first-pitch ball with Marcus Semien at the plate. Detroit manager A.J. Hinch came out of the dugout to argue that Semien had fouled it off but the call stood. Skubal threw two strikes and Moore gave a warning to the irked pitcher before Semien grounded out. Josh Jung then went down swinging. Josh Smith broke up the perfect game by lining a single to left leading off the sixth. Ezequiel Duran was hit by a pitch before Haggerty blooped a one-out single to right to drive in Smith. Skubal escaped further damage on a strikeout and a fielder's choice. Skubal struck out two more batters in the seventh. --Field Level Media",

    "title": "Warm American welcome for new pope masks US church's deep divide",
    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - As Pope Leo XIV celebrated his first Mass as pontiff at the Sistine Chapel on Friday, he spoke a few words in English. It was a reminder - if anyone needed one - that a baseball fan who hails from Chicago was now leader of the Roman Catholic Church. For American Catholics, the elevation ofRobert Prevostto the papacy was a shock, a cause for celebration and a chance for some fun. After the announcement, social media lit up with memes about Leo eating hotdogs, bringing deep dish pizza to the Vatican and switching out the Popemobile for a pickup truck. But despite the warm embrace of his countrymen and women, the deeply divided U.S. Catholic Church may ultimately pose some of the most serious challenges for the new pope. Those divisions, which mirror more generalized political polarization in the U.S., are evident in a host of issues: immigration, same-sex couples, climate change and the role of women in the Church, among other issues. The split has grown wider in recent years as a growing segment of conservative Catholics becomes increasingly vocal and assertive. Pope Francis - who was seen as more progressive-minded thanks to his views on climate change and migration -saw his popularity decline in the U.S. over timeas the conservative influence helped shape opinions: In 2024, about 75% of U.S. Catholics viewed Francis favorably, down from about 90% in 2015, according to a Pew Research Poll. Cathleen Kaveny, a theology and law professor at Boston College who has closely tracked the split between conservatives and progressives, said the new pontiff could salve some wounds between the sides while deepening others. Kaveny expects Leo, with his expertise in canon law and administration at the Vatican, to embrace his predecessor's vision of a church dedicated to the poor and open to all, what she described as a “trickle-up theory of paying attention to people and what they think.” If Kaveny proves right, traditionalists and conservatives may balk. “Pope Leo XIV is an institution builder and he will institutionalize Pope Francis’ visions - or, at least, certain aspects of them,” she said. Steve Bannon, the conservative strategist and Catholic who advised President Donald Trump during his first term, also expects continuity. \"He’s an ideological twin to Francis,\" he said in an interview with Reuters. That said, American conservatives may appreciate that the new pontiff will likely show more discretion than Francis, Kaveny said, perhaps shifting focus away from some of the more contentious issues such outreach to the gay and transgender faithful. In their politics, U.S. Catholics have swung more conservative, withright-wing mediaand Trump-era culture wars combining as powerful influence within the church. Catholics voted for Trump 59%-39% over Democrat Kamala Harris in the November presidential election, a 12 percentage point swing from 2020, according to exit polling by Edison Research. Trump, whose cabinet is about one-third Catholic, expressed pride at having an American in charge at the Vatican. An AI-generated image ofTrump dressed as popewas posted on a White House social media account last weekend; the president told reporters he had nothing to do with the image. Despite Trump's welcome, Leo may also find himself in the crosshairs of Trump supporters, some of whom have described him as a globalist, liberal and woke-minded. Leo has a handful of disapproving posts about the Republican leaders' policies on the X account of Robert Prevost. Among the posts are one questioning Trump's migration policies and another reposting an article headlined, \"JD Vance is wrong: Jesus doesn't ask us to rank our love for others.\" \"He’s got that same Latin American liberation theology radicalness to him,\" Bannon said, referring to Leo. \"He’s virulently anti-Trump.\" The share of Americans who describe themselves as Catholic has changed little over the last decade, hovering around 20%, according to Pew Research. During that time, the Church has been rocked by sex abuse scandals that have resulted in costly legal settlements and bankruptcies, while dragging on church attendance and donations. A number of U.S. dioceses, including in Leo's hometown of Chicago, have been forced to close churches, while others have fallen into disrepair. Despite Francis' cost-cutting efforts and financial management, the Vatican faces an $94.22 millionbudget shortfall, two sources have told Reuters, and a much larger funding gap in its pension fund. David Gibson, director of the Center on Religion and Culture at Fordham University, said that Leo’s ascension cements the movement ignited by Francis to broaden the appeal of the church and make it accessible to more people. At times that has come at the expense of tradition, such as the move by Francis to restrict the celebration of the Latin Mass, which enraged his conservative critics. \"The conservatives have no place to go. Leo is 69 and could be around for 15 to 20 years,” Gibson said. “This is the church now - finding how to preach the Gospel in modern times. The conservatives will have to figure out how they’re going to live in that church.” Still, Leo is an American, and experts said it remained to be seen how the novelty of the first U.S.-born pope - and his understanding of U.S. Catholics - could play out. \"There's a certain kind of opportunity he has in this moment to appeal and to be a symbol that can unite and that could go a way in pulling us together,\" said Nancy Pineda-Madrid, associate professor of theology at Boston College. \"I think in many ways he can stretch us here in the United States in ways that are wonderful and rich,\" she said.",

    "title": "Federal appeals court skeptical over NASCAR antitrust case",
    "content": "May 10 - Although Michael Jordan's 23XI Racing team and Front Row Motorsports won a preliminary injunction in their antitrust lawsuit against NASCAR last December, it might not stand up to scrutiny on appeal. The case went before a panel of three judges in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday in Richmond, Va. The judges appeared to lean toward NASCAR's argument that the basis of the injunction was flawed. 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports were granted an injunction that allowed them to operate as chartered NASCAR teams despite not signing a charter. The two teams had refused to sign a take-it-or-leave-it charter agreement presented last September, which the other 13 organizations in the Cup Series signed. NASCAR filed its appeal in February. NASCAR asserted that U.S. District Judge Kenneth D. Bell misapplied antitrust laws and portrayed the release of claims as standard business practice, not anti-competitive conduct. \"If you don't want the contract, you don't enter into it and you sue,\" U.S. Circuit Court Judge Paul Niemeyer said. \"Or if you want the contract, you enter into it, and you've given up past releases. But I think our Omega observation (referencing a 1997 case between a travel agency and TWA) is you can't have your cake and eat it too.\" If the injunction is overturned and the two teams can no longer operate as chartered members, they can still compete in the Cup Series as open teams. NASCAR attorney Christopher Yates noted that the teams would have qualified for every race so far this season even without charter status. However, the attorney representing 23XI and Front Row, Jeffrey Kessler, argued that it would be too disruptive to overturn the initial ruling midstream. \"It will cause havoc to overturn this injunction in the middle of the season, while if it just stays into effect till November, we're done,\" Kessler said. \"And then we'll have a trial and we'll either win or lose.\" NASCAR's recent countersuit against 23XI and Front Row said they were engaging in an \"illegal cartel\" to try to extract more favorable contracts from the racing league. A trial is set for Dec. 1, but it is unknown whether the panel will make a decision regarding the injunction anytime soon. --Field Level Media",

    "title": "US judge halts land exchange for Rio Tinto copper mine opposed by Native Americans",
    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from transferring land to Rio Tinto(RIO.L), opens new taband BHP(BHP.AX), opens new tabfor a copper mineopposed by Native Americans, citing the Supreme Court's ongoing deliberations in the complex case. The long-running fight over the Resolution Copper project pits the religious rights of Arizona's San Carlos Apache people against rising demand for copper for the energy transition and Washington's drive to expand minerals production. In an 18-page order, U.S. District Judge Steven Logan said the Apache Stronghold - a nonprofit group of the Apache and their allies - is likely tosucceed in its appeal to the Supreme Courtand thus the land transfer should be halted for now. \"It is abundantly clear that the balance of equities tips sharply in (Apache Stronghold's) favor, and that even in the short term, they have established a likelihood of irreparable harm should the transfer proceed,\" Logan said. The dispute centers on the federally owned Oak Flat Campground where many Apache worship their deities. The site sits atop a reserve of more than 40 billion pounds (18.1 million metric tons) of copper, a crucial component of electric vehicles and nearly every electronic device. The Resolution project would, if built, cause a crater 2 miles (3 km) wide and 1,000 feet (304 m) deep that would slowly engulf that worship site. Since 2021, courts have rejected a request by the Apache to block the transfer. The rulingsdeferred to a 2014 decisionmade by the U.S. Congress and then-President Barack Obama. President Donald Trumpstarted the land transferin his first term, a moveundoneby successor Joe Biden while the issue wound its way through courts. The U.S. Supreme Court is now considering whether to take the case. The Supreme Court has said at least 13 times it will continue to deliberate on the appeal request, an unusually long time frame. Meanwhile, Trump last monthrestarted the land transferprocess, with his administration aiming to complete it as soon as June 16, a move that prompted the emergency request to Logan. Logan said in his Friday ruling \"there is good reason to anticipate\" that the Supreme Court will take the case, adding that Rio and BHP's promises they would maintain public access to the land for as long as safely possible \"are insufficient,\" as they are not legally binding. Logan swept aside a Rio executive's testimony - made at ahearing earlier this week- of the $2.7 billion spent on Resolution thus far and an additional $11 million a month on maintenance as the company's \"voluntary choice.\" In a statement to Reuters, Rio said it was reviewing the district court's ruling. \"This short-term order ... changes nothing about the merits of the legal issues currently before the Supreme Court,\" said a Rio spokesperson. BHP, which owns 45% of the project to Rio's 55%, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Wendsler Nosie, one of Apache Stronghold's leaders, said he was \"grateful the judge stopped this land grab in its tracks so that the Supreme Court has time to protect Oak Flat from destruction.\"",

    "title": "Warriors will have to find new winning formula against Timberwolves in Game 3",
    "content": "May 10 - The Minnesota Timberwolves hope their third California adventure of the postseason proves to be as fruitful as the first two when they tip off a two-game sequence of the Western Conference playoffs against the Golden State Warriors in San Francisco on Saturday night. The teams are scheduled for Game 3 on Saturday and Game 4 on Monday in the best-of-seven series, with the clubs each having won a game when the Western semifinals opened in Minneapolis earlier in the week. As the sixth seed in the West, the Timberwolves were the underdogs when they began their first-round series with a road win over the third-seeded Los Angeles Lakers last month. Minnesota came away from the trip with a split, then never lost again in a 4-1 elimination of the Lakers, a three-game winning streak that included a clinching victory back in L.A. in Game 5. The upset win earned the Timberwolves the home-court advantage over the Warriors, who also pulled a first-round surprise as the West's No. 7 seed, outlasting the Houston Rockets in seven games. When last seen at home, Golden State blew a chance to wrap up the first-round series in six games, dropping a 115-107 decision to the second-seeded Rockets last Friday. The Warriors have been on the road ever since, having returned to Houston for a successful Game 7 before heading straight to Minneapolis for Games 1 and 2. As it did against the Rockets, Golden State gained an immediate upper hand against the Timberwolves with a 99-88 road win on Tuesday. But they lost star guard Stephen Curry to a strained left hamstring in the process. Curry, who sat out Thursday's 117-93 loss in the rematch at Minnesota, already has been ruled out of Games 3 and 4. He is scheduled to be re-evaluated on the eve of Game 5 when the clubs return to the Timberwolves' home floor. Coincidentally, the Warriors were without Jimmy Butler when they hosted the Rockets in Game 3 after the key in-season acquisition suffered a pelvic contusion in Houston. That didn't stop Golden State from going up 2-1 in the series behind Curry's 36 points in the first of consecutive home games, before Butler returned to contribute 27 points to a Game 4 victory. If there was a positive to Thursday's blowout, it was that Warriors coach Steve Kerr was able to experiment with different combinations in an effort to find new sources of production that could help minimize the impact of Curry being out. Jonathan Kuminga, who saw action in just three of the seven games in the Houston series, hit 8 of 11 shots in an 18-point, eye-opening performance. Trayce Jackson-Davis, who left the bench for just 24 minutes against the Rockets, chipped in with 15 points and six rebounds. \"There's no Steph. It's a completely different team,\" Kerr assured Friday when asked if he had rotation changes in mind for Game 3. \"Everything has to be about finding a new formula, and JK (Kuminga) is absolutely a part of that formula.\" Continuing the thought, he added, \"(Jackson-Davis) showed he can be effective against this team.\" Golden State's new look hardly impacted the Timberwolves, who rode big nights from Julius Randle (24 points, 11 assists) and Nickeil Alexander-Walker (20 point) to the one-sided win. Make no mistake, Minnesota coach Chris Finch insisted afterward, the best thing that happened all night was when star Anthony Edwards, who went to the locker room after suffering an injury to his left ankle in the second quarter, returned to the lineup after halftime. \"There's lots of ways being an elite athlete pays off,\" he noted. \"Being able to shake those things off certainly is one of them. I was really planning on not seeing him the rest of the game.\" --Field Level Media",

The Defence Ministry said the attacks occurred during athree-day ceasefirerunning from May 8-10 that Russia has unilaterally declared to mark the 80th anniversary of victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two. Ukraine has called the ceasefire a \"farce\" and on Friday documented scores of armed clashes. It noted in particular, northeastern Sumy region, site of some of the heaviest Russian assaults in recent weeks, saying there had been no letup during the Kremlin-inspired ceasefire. \"There has been no 'ceasefire' in Sumy region on the 8th or 9th of May. Over the two days Russia has killed three civilians,\nthe region's military administration said on Telegram. Ukraine's military, in its account late on Friday of battlefield operations, said 162 armed clashes had been recorded over the past 24 hours, with the Kremlin ceasefire in effect, along with 22 air strikes and 956 drone attacks. It noted heavy fighting near Pokrovsk, a logistics hub in eastern Ukraine targeted by Moscow's troops for months. Russian forces had attempted to break through Ukrainian lines 51 times. The Russian Defence Ministry account said it had registered four attempts by Ukrainian forces to smash through the border into the Kursk and Belgorod regions in the past week. In eastern Ukraine, Kyiv's troops had attacked Russian forces 15 times during the ceasefire, the ministry said. Ukraine has said Russia had repeatedly breached its own truce this week. The governor of the southeastern Zaporizhzhia region said on Friday that Russia hit eight Ukrainian frontline villages 220 times since the ceasefire went into effect. In Russia's Belgorod border region, the local governor said a Ukrainian drone had attacked a government building on Friday. In Kursk, Ukrainian troops launched a major incursion last August and held onto a chunk of Russian territory for many months as Moscow's forces battled to eject them with help from North Korean soldiers. Some fighting has continued, even after Putin last month declared \"victory\" in Kursk. Ukraine said its troops had repelled 19 attacks in the region. Rybar, a pro-Russian war blogger, said there was \"high-intensity fighting\" between Russian and Ukrainian troops near Tetkino, a village in the region. Rybar and other bloggers said Ukrainian attacks on multiple villages in the neighbouring Belgorod region were continuing on Friday. Reuters could not independently verify statements by war bloggers or battlefield reports from either side. Ukraine and Russia both accused the other of repeatedly violating a previous 30-hourEaster ceasefiredeclared by Putin.",

    "title": "Tufts student released from US immigration custody after judge's order",
    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - A Tufts University student from Turkey who was held for over six weeks in an immigration detention center in Louisiana after co-writing an opinion piece criticizing her school's response toIsrael's war in Gazawas released from custody on Friday after a federal judge granted her bail. U.S. District Judge William Sessions during a hearing in Burlington, Vermont, ordered the immediate release ofRumeysa Ozturk, who is at the center of one of the highest-profile cases to emerge from Republican PresidentDonald Trump'scampaign to deport pro-Palestinian activists on American campuses. The judge said Ozturk, whose arrest in Massachusetts in March was captured in a viral video, had raised a substantial claim that the sole reason she was being detained was \"simply and purely the expression that she made or shared in the op-ed in violation of her First Amendment rights.\" \"Her continued detention potentially chills the speech of the millions and millions of individuals in this country who are not citizens,\" Sessions said. \"Any one of them may now avoid exercising their First Amendment rights for fear of being whisked away to a detention center.\" Ozturk, who appeared before the judge virtually from the Louisiana detention facility, could be seen hugging one of her attorneys after the judge ordered her release from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's custody. She was released hours later, her legal team said. The judge will take up arguments in her underlying lawsuit at a later hearing. \"We are so relieved that Rumeysa will soon be back in Massachusetts, and won't stop fighting until she is free for good,\" Jessie Rossman, a lawyer for Ozturk at the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts, said in a statement. Massachusetts-based Tufts has said it plans to help provide Ozturk housing upon her release. In a statement, a university spokesperson said it hoped she would be able to rejoin its community as soon as possible to resume her doctoral studies. White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller called the judge's ruling another sign of what he considers a \"judicial coup\" in the United States. Several parts of the president's hardline immigration agenda have been blocked by judges. \"We cannot individually litigate every single visa that we want to revoke,\" Miller told reporters. The judge ruled shortly after a federal appeals courtrejected, opens new tabthe Trump administration's bid to re-detain Columbia University student Mohsen Mahdawi, a Palestinian campus activist who a different judge in Vermontordered releasedlast week after immigration authorities arrested him as well. Ozturk wasarrested on March 25by masked, plainclothes officers on a street in the Boston suburb of Somerville, Massachusetts, near her home after the U.S. Department of State revoked her student visa. The sole basis authorities have provided for revoking her visa was an opinion piece she co-authored in Tufts' student newspaper criticizing the school's response to calls by students to divest from companies with ties to Israel and to \"acknowledge the Palestinian genocide.\" Her lawyers at the ACLU argue that her arrest and detention were unlawfully designed to punish her for speech protected by the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment and to chill the speech of others. The PhD student and Fulbright scholar was moved to a detention center in Basile, Louisiana, even though her lawyer filed a lawsuit in Massachusetts the day she was arrested and a judge there barred her from being moved out of the state without 48 hours' notice. By the time that order came down, ICE had already taken her to Vermont, where she was held briefly before being flown to Louisiana. A judge in Massachusetts subsequently transferred her case to Vermont, saying it could be properly heard there. Sessions, an appointee of Democratic President Bill Clinton, then ordered that Ozturk be moved to Vermont so she could be available while he considered her \"significant constitutional concerns.\" A federal appeals court on Wednesdayorderedher transferred back to Vermont by May 14, but Sessions opted to proceed with a previously-scheduled bail hearing on Friday and allow Ozturk to appear remotely after her lawyers said she was suffering from worsening asthma attacks while in custody. She suffered one such asthma attack in the middle of Friday's hearing. She told the judge she had suffered about a dozen while in custody, more than at any time in the last two years, which she blamed on the \"challenging\" conditions of her confinement in an overly-packed space with poor air ventilation. \"The duration and frequency have increased because of both the constant triggers surrounding me and also the stressful environment that I am living in right now,\" Ozturk said. (This story has been corrected to clarify that Bill Clinton appointed the judge, not Barack Obama, in paragraph 17)",

    "title": "Fed's Musalem: Should not commit to rate cuts until tariff impact becomes certain",
    "content": "PALO ALTO, May 9 (Reuters) - The Fed should not commit to further interest rate cuts until it is clear whether the Trump administration's tariff policies lead to persistent inflation or a less serious, one-time adjustment in prices, St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem said on Friday. Musalem said he currently puts even odds on either of the two paths for inflation. In theory, tariffs should prompt a one-time price jump similar to the imposition of a tax; but coming off the heels of recent high inflation the effect could be longer-lasting, and may also be more persistent since the new levies hit intermediate goods, for example. That's a reason not to jump to conclusions, he said. The Fed cuts its policy rate by a full percentage point last year but has not made a move since December, with the Trump administration's tariff plans now posing the risk of renewed price pressures. \"It is possible that higher inflation will be short-lived and mostly concentrated in the second half of 2025, as businesses run down inventories and pass tariffs on new goods purchased onto customers as one-off price increases,\" Musalem, a current voter on interest rate policy, said in remarks prepared for delivery at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. \"It is equally likely that inflation could prove to be more persistent.\" \"Committing now to looking through the inflation impact of tariffs, or to an easing of policy, runs the risk of underestimating the level and persistence of inflation,\" Musalem said. \"Mistiming the policy switch can be costly for the public in terms of inflation and employment outcomes.\" It would still be appropriate to cut rates \"if tariffs are sustained but inflation is short-lived, inflation expectations remain anchored, and economic activity is meaningfully slower,\" Musalem said. But right now all of those issues remain up in the air. The Trump administration has not decided what the final tariff schedule will be, and the issue may be unresolved for months still to come. Meanwhile, even though business and household confidence is falling, economic data on employment and inflation have yet to register much reaction to Trump's efforts to reorder the global trading system. That has been an argument in favor of the Fed keeping the policy rate intact, cited by officials this week when they unanimously agreed to maintain the rate in the current 4.25% to 4.5% range. Officials have largely agreed that they will have trouble making a decision on further policy moves until an array of administration policy decisions have been finalized and the impact on the economy clarified.",

    "content": "May 10 - The Baltimore Orioles activated outfielder Tyler O'Neill from the 10-day injured list prior to Friday night's road game against the Los Angeles Angels. O'Neill hasn't played for Baltimore since April 23 due to a neck injury. He is slated to bat sixth and play right field on Friday in Anaheim. Infielder Coby Mayo was optioned to Triple-A Norfolk in a corresponding move. O'Neill, 29, is batting just .215 with two homers and 10 RBIs in 18 games in his first season with the Orioles. He started off with a big game on Opening Day when he hit a three-run homer against the Toronto Blue Jays to extend his major league record of homering on Opening Day to six years in a row. O'Neill finished 3-for-3 with three runs, three RBIs and two walks in the 12-2 victory. O'Neill was batting .379 after a two-hit game against the Kansas City Royals on April 5. He then fell into a 3-for-36 funk (.083) before being placed on the IL. O'Neill was activated after going 2-for-6 in a two-game rehab with Norfolk. The eight-year veteran has a .245 career average with 111 homers and 288 RBIs in 608 games with the St. Louis Cardinals (2018-23), Boston Red Sox (2024) and Orioles. He had a career-high 34 homers for the Cardinals in 2021 and hit 31 for the Red Sox last season. Mayo, 23, is 1-for-12 in four games with Baltimore this season. Overall, he is 5-for-53 (.094) in 21 major league games for the Orioles. --Field Level Media",

    "title": "ECB should keep steady hand, hold rates close to current levels, Schnabel says",
    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank should stop cutting borrowing costs as turmoil in the global economy is fuelling price pressures and inflation was at risk of exceeding the bank's 2% target in the medium term, ECB board member Isabel Schnabel said on Friday. The ECB cut interest rates seven times in the past year as inflation has been rapidly retreating, and policymakers have already started to lay the groundwork foranother cut on June 5, taking the deposit rate to 2%. Schnabel, an outspoken policy hawk, poured cold water on those expectations, making an explicit argument for keeping rates unchanged since they are already low enough not to hold back the economy. \"Now is the time to keep a steady hand,\" Schnabel told a conference at Stanford University. \"The appropriate course of action is to keep rates close to where they are today – that is, firmly in neutral territory.\" Financial markets see a 90% chance of a rate cut in June and see another cut or two in subsequent months, indicating that Schnabel's view goes counter to investor bets. The complication for policymakers is that short-term and medium-term inflationary forces are quite different. In the near term, inflation could even dip below the ECB's 2% target given lower energy costs, a strong euro, anaemic economic growth and high uncertainty created by the U.S. administration's trade war, Schnabel argued. But monetary policy affects the economy with long lags and by the time further policy easing really impacts the economy, the drag on inflation may have faded, replaced by quite different forces that push up costs, she argued. Inflation could be boosted by an expected government spending surge, driven by Germany's pledge to boost defence and infrastructure investment. But more importantly, trade fragmentation, a byproduct of U.S.-imposed tariffs, could also push up costs and boost prices. \"Over the medium term, risks to euro area inflation are likely tilted to the upside, reflecting both the increase in fiscal spending and the risks of renewed cost-push shocks from tariffs propagating through global value chains,\" Schnabel said. Schnabel even challenged the argument that U.S. tariffs without European retaliation are net deflationary for the euro area. \"Even if the EU does not retaliate, higher production costs transmitted through global value chains could more than offset the disinflationary pressure coming from lower foreign demand, making tariffs inflationary overall,\" Schnabel argued. Retaliation, as already outlined by the bloc, would only magnify this process and keep pressure on prices further out. By keeping a steady hand, the ECB could buy insurance against a wide range of possible outcomes and this approach would be robust enough to deal with different scenarios, Schnabel argued.",

    "content": "PALO ALTO, May 9 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's unfolding trade policy may curb U.S. productivity and possibly require higher interest rates to contain inflation in a less efficient economy, Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook said on Friday. \"I expect to see a drag on productivity in the near term stemming from the recent changes to trade policy and the related uncertainty,\" Cook said in remarks prepared for a delivery at an economics conference at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. Uncertainty around Trump's plans could discourage investment, Cook said, while the rising cost of imported intermediate goods and equipment could also delay projects that would otherwise enhance productivity. \"Uncertainty around trade policy is likely to reduce business investment going forward. At this time, firms do not know the ultimate level and incidence of tariffs or their duration,\" Cook said. \"Higher costs of imported materials and components could also cause firms to delay or scale back their investment plans.\" Less capital investment \"can lead to slower technological innovation and adoption and decreased overall efficiency,\" she said, while higher trade barriers could \"prop up less efficient firms\" and make the economy less competitive. Supply disruptions could create a further inefficiency, Cook said. Artificial intelligence could raise productivity, she said, and it remains far from clear what the net result will be over time. She said tariffs on their own could lower potential output. Just as recent gains in productivity have helped boost growth and bring down U.S. inflation, \"a reduction in potential gross domestic product means less slack in the economy which, in tern, means greater inflationary pressure\" and potentially higher interest rates, she said.",

    "title": "Exclusive: Fed’s Hammack wants clear data before moving on rates, not much data by June",
    "content": "PALO ALTO, California, May 9 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve needs more time to see how the economy responds to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff and other policies before figuring out the right response, Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack said on Friday, noting that much of the administration's sweeping agenda remains unclear. \"I stand ready to move whenever we have clear and convincing evidence, but ... given the overall breadth of the policies that have been discussed and put in place, I think there's a real question about what those impacts are going to look like, and so it may take longer,\" Hammack said. \"There's not a lot of data between now and June,\" when the Fed next meets to set interest rates, she said in an interview on the sidelines of a monetary policy conference at Stanford University's Hoover Institution in which she elaborated on the Fed's current dilemma. While the latest data showed the U.S. economy contracted at a 0.3% annualized rate last quarter, for example, most analysts feel that's not a clear signal of the economic direction because of distortions driven by trade policy; to Hammack, the economy has been resilient and the jury is still out on its future course. \"It is all premature to me -- I think everything is very fluid and I think we need to really wait and see how the data play out,\" she said. Likewise, she and her fellow policymakers have noted the strength of the job market, where the unemployment rate stands at a low 4.2%, but also acknowledge the risks to the labor market as businesses begin thinking about the fallout from new tariff policies. If the impact of tariffs lifting prices proves to be limited and the economy weakens, \"We'd want to really focus on the employment side of our mandate,\" she said. The Fed this week left short-term interest rates in the 4.25%-4.50% range, where they have been since December. While tariffs raise the risk of both higher inflation and higher unemployment, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, it’s not yet clear by how much, or for how long, or in what order, and with trade negotiations underway and the full scope of levies unknown, it’s too early to know how the Fed should respond. Contacts in Hammack's district are laying contingency plans to shrink their workforce if demand weakens, she said. But for now firms are hanging on to their workers after years of finding it hard to hire, she said. \"People don't know which way it will settle out,\" she said. On inflation, she said, tariffs could prompt only one-time price increases. But she said some businesses say they plan to make a series of price adjustments over time as they learn what level of import taxes they face -- a process that could itself last until well into the summer. The longer the issues play out, Fed officials worry, the more risk there is that inflation becomes persistent. That would require tighter Fed policy. All in all, uncertainty over government policies is \"clouding the outlook and raising the risks of higher inflation, slower growth, and softening in the labor market,\" she said in remarks prepared for delivery Friday at the conference. \"Given the economy’s starting point, with inflation still elevated and with both sides of our mandate expected to be under pressure, there is a strong case to hold monetary policy steady at its current modestly restrictive setting.\" Taking no action, she added, is the best choice as the Fed looks to balance the potentially competing dangers ahead. \"It's important for us to sit back and make sure we're thinking about all of the different policies, because they do work in different directions, right? The spending policies, deregulation, all of these tariffs could have different consequences,\" she said. \"And so it's important for us to look at it holistically.\"",

    "title": "Trump says he's OK with taxing the rich but warns of political fallout",
    "content": "WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - U.S. PresidentDonald Trumpsaid on Friday he was \"OK\" with raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans, as his fellow Republicans consider scaling back the scope of the ambitious tax-cut package they aim to pass this year. \"Republicans should probably not do it, but I'm OK if they do!!!\" Trump wrote in a post on his social media platform. Speaking to reporters later at the White House, Trump gave a stronger endorsement. \"I would love to do it, frankly,\" he said in the Oval Office. \"What you're doing is you're giving up something up top in order to make people in the middle income and the lower income brackets save more. So it's really a redistribution, and I'm willing to do it if they want.\" Trump, a wealthy businessman with properties all over the world, indicated he would be willing to pay more in taxes himself. \"I would love to be able to give people in a lower bracket a big break by giving up some of what I have.\" The Senate's top Republican, John Thune, said he was not enthusiastic about the idea. \"We don't want to raise taxes on anybody. I mean, we're about lowering taxes on Americans,\" he said on Fox News. Trump's message comes as U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson weighs whether to reduce the total tax package. Johnson told some House Republicans on Thursday that he is now looking at $4 trillion in tax cuts, rather than an initial $4.5 trillion, according to a Republican aide. Republicans are also fighting over spending cuts needed to pay for Trump's \"one big beautiful bill,\" jeopardizing the goal of making all ofthe expiring provisionsof his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent. Trump privately urged Johnson this week to raise the tax rate and close the carried-interest loophole for Wall Street investors,sources told Reuterson Thursday. The Republican president suggested an increase to 39.6% from 37% for individuals earning $2.5 million or higher and joint filers earning at least $5 million, with carve-outs for small businesses, one source said. \"I don't think they're going to be doing it, but I actually think it's good politics to do it,\" Trump said. Spending cuts to Medicaid and other programs are likely to fall short of a $2 trillion goal over a decade. Johnson and other top Republicans have resisted the idea of raising taxes on the wealthy. But Representative Andy Harris, who chairs the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus, said a higher top tax bracket would help pay for the Trump agenda. \"Personally, I've always believed that if we can’t find spending reductions elsewhere, we should look at restoring the pre TCJA tax bracket on million dollar income,\" the Maryland Republican wrote on X. Trump views higher taxes on the rich as a way to help pay for massive middle and working-class tax cuts, and to protect Medicaid, the healthcare program for lower-income Americans. But the president warned on Friday that Democrats would seize on \"even a 'TINY' tax increase for the 'RICH,'\" citing former Republican President George H.W. Bush, who lost his 1992 re-election bid after breaking his promise not to hike taxes. Trump and Republican lawmakers have cited the potential extension of the 2017 tax cuts as relief for Americans and an economic boost amid Trump'stariffson imported goods. They have vowed to enact the extension as part of a larger budget bill that would also fund border security, the deportation of undocumented immigrants, energy deregulation and a plus-up in military spending.",

    "content": "BEIJING/WASHINGTON, May 10 (Reuters) - China and the United States start their first major Trade War Two meeting on Saturday to pull back from what analysts describe as a lose-lose situation for their economies, without much clarity on what a win would look like for either side. China is at the epicentre of U.S. PresidentDonald Trump'sglobaltrade warthat has roiled financial markets, upended supply chains and fuelled risks of a sharp worldwideeconomic downturn. Washington wants to reduce its trade deficit with Beijing and convince China to renounce what the U.S. says is a mercantilist economic model and contribute more to global consumption, which would imply, among other things,painful domestic reforms. Beijing resists any outside interference with its development path as it sees industrial and technological advancement as crucial to avoid the middle income trap. It wants Washington to remove tariffs, specify what it wants China to buy more of, and be treated as equals on the global stage. The two sides seem much further apart and at greater risk of a major fallout than during their first trade war in Trump's previous term. And as U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and chief trade negotiator Jamieson Greer meet China's economic tsar He Lifeng in Switzerland, none of these outcomes look realistic, analysts say. The triple-digit, two-way tariffs are not the only point of tension in the weekend talks. Non-trade issues such asfentanyl, tech restrictions and geopolitics including the war in Ukraine are likely to further complicate the path to any resolution to a trade conflict that is disrupting the global economy. Indeed, in an indication of how deeply non-tariff issues are in the mix, China is sending a top public-security official to the talks, a source familiar with the plans said. \"They're not going to resolve anything this weekend, other than just trying to determine if there's going to be a process, and what the agenda items will be,\" said Scott Kennedy, an expert in Chinese business affairs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. The best-case scenario for financial markets at this early stage would be an agreement to bring down tariffs from an excess of 100% - widely seen by markets as a virtual trade embargo - to levels that would allow products to flow each way, but still be hefty on American and Chinese businesses. Trump, who unveiled the details of anew trade agreementbetween the United States and Britain, has signaled that punitive U.S. tariffs of 145% on Beijing would likelycome down, and on Friday floated an alternative figure for the first time, saying on his social media platform that 80% \"seems right.\" Even that is 20 points above the level he pledged on the campaign trail last year to levy against Chinese goods, and it was unclear how it would be received by the team from China, if it is presented by his negotiating team at all over the weekend. \"I expect Beijing will insist on receiving the same 90-day waiver on tariffs that all other countries received to create conducive conditions for negotiations,\" said Ryan Hass, director of the John L. Thornton China Center at the Brookings Institution, adding that breakthroughs are unlikely. \"Since the U.S. decisions to escalate tariffs were made arbitrarily, the decision to de-escalate tariffs can similarly be made arbitrarily.\" Most analysts don't expect a waiver. But a tariff reduction, however small, and an agreement for follow-up talks that could eventually encompass non-trade issues like fentanyl would still be seen as a positive outcome by investors. \"If there is a temporary truce or symmetrical rollback of tariffs, that would be conducive to future potential holistic negotiation efforts,\" said Bo Zhengyuan, Shanghai-based partner at consultancy firm Plenum. While either side might be able to dress any rollbacks as an early win to their domestic audiences, Chinese factories and their workers are likely to start feeling the tariff pain in coming months, while Americans are staring athigher prices and unemployment. And the root cause of the conflict will still be there. The lopsided global trade environment in which most economies around the world rely too heavily on affordable and efficient Chinese production on the supply side and wealthy American consumers for demand won't be fixed by next week. But markets for now are at least relieved that the world's leading powers have a chance to walk back from a path of escalating threats that investors feared might spill over from trade into finance and other areas. Lynn Song, ING's chief Greater China economist, expects any de-escalation to bring back tariffs to around 60%, in line with Trump's pre-election pledges. This would \"still be high enough to bar many products with suitable alternatives,\" but also \"a level that allows importers to buy products without substitutions with less pain,\" she said. Before the Saturday meeting, much of the back-channel preparations between China and the United States were bogged down bydisputes over fentanyl, the seniority of negotiating officials, and the tone of rhetoric used by the U.S.,Reuters reported on Friday. Conflictingstatements from both sides over who approached whom led to a furtherhardeningin Beijing's public messaging, as one state newspaper warned of a \"protracted struggle\". However, China last week signalled through a state media-affiliated blog that engaging in talks \"does no harm at this stage\" and that Beijing can \"use this opportunity to observe, and even draw out the U.S.'s true intentions\". Analysts say that Beijing's attempts to portray Washington as the more anxious and pressured party give it political cover to engage in talks, as well as projecting strength domestically. \"We are not watching anymore for who blinks first, but for how either side will spin the other as having blinked first,\" said a Beijing-based diplomat.",

With a Coppa Italia win, Milan will have two trophies this season, having also lifted the Supercoppa in early January, but Conceicao did not want to speculate if a win would secure his future. \"I am accustomed to certain things. This is not the moment to talk about me. At the right moment, I will speak,\" he said. Bologna coach Vincenzo Italiano was unhappy with the final part of the match, where his side collapsed against an aggressive Milan who scored all three goals in the last minutes. \"We were in control of the game, had chances to score a second goal, but there was a 15-minute blackout that I cannot explain,\" Italiano told Sky Sport Italia. \"It was the worst 15 minutes I’d seen from my team in a long while, but otherwise we played with character and could’ve added more goals. \"We will analyse this, because on Wednesday we need a different approach from those who came off the bench, as I liked the way we started.\"",

    "title": "Trump cannot use new executive order to skirt 'sanctuary' cities ruling, judge says",
    "content": "May 8 (Reuters) - A federal judge warned on Friday that a new executive order from PresidentDonald Trumpthat calls for cutting off funding to so-called sanctuary jurisdictions that do not cooperate with his immigration agenda cannot be used to evade a court order barring his administration from doing just that. U.S. District Judge William Orrick in San Francisco issued Friday'sorder, opens new tabat the urging of 16 cities and counties nationally that had alreadysecured an injunctionbarring the administration from withholding all federal funding to them. Those cities and counties, led by San Francisco, sued after Trump signed two earlier executive orders in January and February that they said unlawfully threatened to cut off funding to them unless they cooperated with federal immigration law enforcement, including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The jurisdictions include the cities of Minneapolis; New Haven, Connecticut; Portland, Oregon; St. Paul, Minnesota; Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Seattle, all of which have laws and policies that limit or prevent local law enforcement from assisting federal officers with civil immigration arrests. Four days after Orrick issued the injunction in April, Trump signed a new executive order directing Attorney General Pam Bondi to create a list of sanctuary jurisdictions and for agencies to then identify grants and other funding to them they could cancel or suspend. The 16 local governments argued Trump issued the new executive order in \"blatant disregard\" for Orrick's court order and urged him to enforce his injunction. Orrick, who during Trump's first term in office blocked enforcement of a similar 2017 executive order targeting sanctuary jurisdictions, said on Friday that the latest order had some material differences from the earlier ones and, in some respects, may even resolve problems he identified in them. He said the administration could potentially identify funds to rescind if there was enough of a connection between the funding stream and the jurisdiction's \"sanctuary\" policies. But Orrick said if Trump's latest order was used to instead target funds unrelated to sanctuary policies, their suspension would violate the U.S. Constitution just as the earlier executive orders did. He said the context surrounding Trump's new order raises the threat that the government would use it \"to unconstitutionally coerce the cities and Counties (and other jurisdictions like them) into changing their policies and practices to conform with the second Trump administration's preferences.\" San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu in a statement said Friday's order \"makes clear that the federal government cannot use Executive Orders or other agency action to withhold federal funding as a coercive threat against sanctuary jurisdictions.\" The U.S. Department of Justice did not respond to requests for comment.",

    "title": "Ahead of China-US talks, Trump says 80% tariff 'seems right'",
    "content": "WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday an 80%tariffon Chinese goods \"seems right,\" suggesting for the first time a specific alternative to the 145% levies he has imposed on Chinese imports ahead of closely watched weekend talks between the two countries. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and chief trade negotiator Jamieson Greer will meet Chinese economic tsar He Lifeng in Switzerland to discuss containing the damaging trade war between the world's two biggest economies, which has already entangled global supply chains. Asked how Trump arrived at the 80% figure, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said, \"That was a number the president threw out there, and we'll see what happens this weekend.\" Trump will not unilaterally bring down tariffs on China, however, she stressed. \"We need to see concessions from them as well,\" she said. China is also sending a top public-security official to the talks in Geneva, a source familiar with the plans said. The development, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, underscores the importance of the issue of fentanyl trafficking to the talks and the wider U.S.-China relationship. Trump cited fentanyl as the rationale for the initial imposition of punitiveimport taxeson goods from China, Canada and Mexico earlier this year. China's embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment. \"China should open up its market to USA – would be so good for them!!! Closed markets don't work anymore!!!\" Trump wrote in an all-capssocial media post, opens new tab. \"80% tariff on China seems right. Up to Scott B.,\" he added moments later. Trump on Thursday said he expected there to be substantive talks this weekend andpredicted U.S. tariffs were likely to come down. China's foreign ministryhas decriedwhat it calls abusive and bullying economic tactics and said China remains firmly opposed to what it calls an unsustainable approach to trade by the U.S. Ryan Majerus, partner with the King & Spalding law firm and a former senior Commerce Department official, said the expected decline in port and trade traffic may have created some pressure to start addressing the U.S.-China trade impasse in Geneva. \"I don't see an easy off-ramp for either party,\" he said. \"We could see a more limited agreement that lowers the tariff rates to a degree, depending on what China is willing to do.\" Asked by a reporter in the Oval Office on Friday whether he had given Bessent a number reflecting how low he was willing to go, Trump said yes, though he left it unclear whether his bottom-line figure was the same 80% he floated publicly. \"We have to make a great deal for America,\" he said. \"I put out a number today, 80%, so we'll see how that all works out.\" The weekend talks come on the heels of Trump's first agreement with a major trading partner: Thursday's announcement of a pactwith Britain. While that fueled some optimism in markets, it was fairly limited in scope, and a range of details still need to be hammered out. \"The U.S.-U.K. trade agreement may be better than nothing, but it is not significant enough to warrant a change to our forecast,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote on Friday. \"While talks this weekend between U.S. and Chinese officials may yield some progress, expectations for a significant reduction in tariffs seem unwarranted.\" Oxford estimates that lowering tariffs on China to 80% would bring the overall effective import tax rate from all the tariffs imposed by Trump so far to 18% from around 22% now. That would still be treble what Oxford had estimated at the start of Trump's term and far above the 2-3% average from before he returned to office. While Trump has indicated on several occasions that he expects the tariff rates on China to come down, he had not until now proposed a precise alternative. Even though 80% is just above half the current rate, it remains extraordinarily high, above even the hefty 60% rate that Trump proposed while campaigning for president last year. It was not clear how it would be received by China amid what Bessent has already cast as an effective trade embargo between the two countries. What level tariff rates settle at – and not just for China – has been a central focus for investors rattled by months of financial market volatility arising from the chaotic rollout of Trump's aggressive trade policies. U.S. stocks, which have recouped a significant chunk of their losses since mid-February's record high, finished slightly lower for the week after a quiet session on Friday. The dollar was weaker against a basket of major trading partners' currencies. Since taking office in January, Trump has hiked the tariffs paid by U.S. importers for goods from China to 145%, in addition to those he imposed on many Chinese goods during his first term and the duties levied by the Biden administration. China hit back by imposing export curbs on somerare earthelements, vital for U.S. manufacturers of weapons and electronic consumer goods, and raising tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%. It also imposed extra levies on some products includingsoybeansandliquefied natural gas. Trump's push on tariffs is widely seen to be elevating risks to the U.S. economy, with concerns that they will lift prices for American consumers and businesses while at the same time cutting into the demand that has propped up the job market. Trump is already facing droppingapproval ratingsas Americans brace to pay more for clothes, electronics, toys and countless other goods that emerge from Chinese factories. China's government is seeking tomitigateclosures, bankruptcies and job losses at manufacturers struggling to find viable alternatives to the U.S. market. Representing the meeting's host, Swiss Vice President Guy Parmelin, who also serves as economic minister, emerged from separate bilateral meetings in Geneva with the U.S. and Chinese delegations with optimistic words. \"It's already a success,\" Parmelin told reporters. \"The two sides are talking ... If a road map can emerge and they decide to continue discussions, that will lower the tensions.\"",

    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - A planned protest by camogie players in Ireland over the right to wear shorts has led to the postponement of a provincial final, the Munster Camogie Council said on Friday. Less than 24 hours before the Munster final between Cork and Waterford was due to take place, the decision was made to defer the game after both sets of players had announced their intention to wear shorts, in defiance of the current rules. Theprotestsbegan last weekend, with Dublin and Kilkenny players entering the pitch wearing shorts, and were then forced to change into skorts or the game would be abandoned. The rules of camogie, the women's equivalent of hurling, state that playing gear must include skirt, skort -- a pair of shorts with an overlapping panel resembling a skirt -- or divided skirt. The protests follow a Gaelic Players Association (GPA)surveywhere 83% of players want the choice of wearing shorts, and two motions to introduce shorts were defeated at last year's Camogie Association of Ireland Congress. The Munster final was set to see these protests go even further, after playerssaidthey would not be changing into skorts, and were prepared to forego their chance to play in the final, but that decision has now been taken out of their hands. \"As the current camogie rules of play are still in place and the players have indicated they would not be prepared to play the game in skorts, the decision has been made to defer the game in the best interests of all players and officials involved,\" a statement said. Under the Association's rules, another challenge to the rule could not be put forward until 2027, but on Thursday theyannounceda special congress for May 22 to vote on the issue, but the players were still set to go ahead with their protest. The Munster Council said that details of a rescheduled fixture will be announced in due course, and is likely to be after May 24 when if the motion passes, the new rule giving the option to wear shorts or skorts would take effect.",

Bessent told congressional leaders that they needed to extend the U.S. government's borrowing authority before August, warning that there is a \"reasonable probability\" the federal government would run short of cash to cover its obligations at that point. \"A failure to suspend or increase the debt limit would wreak havoc on our financial system and diminish America's security and global leadership position,\" Bessent wrote in a letter. The U.S. debt currently stands at $36.2 trillion, according to the Treasury Department, above the $36.1 trillion limit set by Congress in January. The Treasury Department has been using temporary financial measures to avoid default, but Bessent warned that it will not be able to do so indefinitely. Republicans who control the House of Representatives and the Senate are trying to advance a sweepingpackage of tax cuts and spending hikesthat would also raise the debt limit by at least $4 trillion. Republicans aim to pass that package by July 4.

    "content": "May 9 - Former Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry has refuted the latest statements made by an ex-employee who maintains the billionaire subjected her to years of sexual harassment and a smear campaign. Lasry was hit by a countersuit seeking $100 million on Thursday from Gina Strum, an attorney and executive. Strum filed the suit in New York Supreme Court, with Lasry's Avenue Capital Group and its co-founder, Sonia Gardner (Lasry's sister), also named as defendants. Strum maintains that \"Lasry exploited his position as CEO of Avenue Capital to manipulate, harass, and retaliate against Strum after she refused his advances and reported misconduct.\" The countersuit states that \"Lasry engaged in a pattern of grooming and predatory behavior, using his authority, personal disclosures, and emotional manipulation to erode professional boundaries and cultivate inappropriate dependence. Strum asserts claims for, among others, sexual harassment, sexual assault, defamation, retaliation, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraud.\" A statement issued Friday by Kekst CNC, which said it represents Lasry and Avenue Capital Group, said the \"repackaging of the lawsuit with an amended complaint demanding $100 million is an attempt to create new headlines. \"Ms. Strum continues to attempt to use the media as part of her malicious campaign to ruin the reputations of Avenue, Marc Lasry, and Sonia Gardner for financial gain. Her new press release is one of several that she has issued in her efforts to generate publicity,\" the statement read. \"Further, it is important to note that the amended complaint Ms. Strum filed yesterday is essentially the same lawsuit that she filed on October 23, 2024. Since that time, she has cycled through multiple law firms and is now on her seventh law firm. As Avenue explained in prior court filings, ‘Ms. Strum's lawyers are either quitting to avoid sanctions, or are being fired by Ms. Strum for refusing to propagate her vicious falsehoods. Her rapid and repeated changes in counsel confirm that there is something fundamentally wrong with Ms. Strum's claims, threats, tactics and gamesmanship.' One of Ms. Strum's prior counsel in this matter ‘filed a ‘noisy' withdrawal citing ethical concerns.'\" In October, Lasry, Avenue Capital and Gardner sued Strum, accusing her of using harassment and blackmail in an attempt to gain $50 million. Strum denied the allegations. Richard Roth, Strum's attorney and managing partner of The Roth Law Firm, said Thursday in a statement, \"The complaint describes a disturbing pattern of physical and emotional misconduct. It asserts that Mr. Lasry exploited years of personal disclosures about his wife and daughters to foster an inappropriate emotional attachment, blurring professional boundaries and positioning Ms. Strum as an emotional surrogate. \"According to the complaint, this manipulation escalated into unwanted touching and ultimately a quid pro quo sexual harassment dynamic -- where Ms. Strum's professional opportunities and financial future were conditioned on tolerating Lasry's personal demands, misconduct, and predatory behavior. The complaint states that Ms. Strum reasonably believed that accepting his pressure to join Avenue internally would inevitably require her to submit to physical sexual demands.\" Avenue's statement on Friday said the October countersuit is not a retaliation but, rather, it \"lay bare Ms. Strum's long course of inappropriate and threatening conduct,\" and called it \"a direct and appropriate response to hold her accountable for her defamatory actions.\" The statement added that Avenue, Mr. Lasry and Ms. Gardner will be pressing their own claims as part of the litigation process. \"Mr. Lasry has never engaged in any inappropriate conduct towards Ms. Strum, and there was no abuse or sexual harassment by Mr. Lasry, as she claims,\" it read. \"As Mr. Lasry's lawsuit against Ms. Strum makes clear, it was Ms. Strum who engaged in repeated inappropriate conduct towards Mr. Lasry. He has refused to give in to Ms. Strum's outrageous demands, choosing instead to litigate in court. \"Additionally, Ms. Strum spitefully sought to harm Ms. Gardner by publishing false information about her health -- statements by Ms. Strum that simply are not true. Ms. Gardner has always worked full time and is in fact in excellent health. Ms. Gardner, a lifelong advocate of women, and Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Capital Development Fund for Gender Equality in Access to Finance, stated: ‘Ms. Strum's allegations of harassment at Avenue, and her lies about my health, have been fabricated as a vindictive and strategic response to being told that her proposed business opportunity was not feasible. Her false claims undermine the legitimate claims of those women in other workplaces who have suffered abuse.'\" Lasry, 65, was part of the Bucks' ownership group from 2014-2023. Earlier this week, Sportico reported that Lasry and Pro Football Hall of Famer Michael Strahan are working to purchase a stake in the New York Giants. --Field Level Media",

    "content": "MADRID, May 9 (Reuters) - Spanish technology company GMV has unveiled a GPS-like navigation system for the moon that aims to make lunar missions as intuitive as a drive across town with apps such as Google Maps or Waze. Called LUPIN, the project is part of a programme by the European Space Agency to test new positioning, navigation and timing techniques as interest in lunar surface exploration picks up again, whether for scientific research, potential mining opportunities or even future tourism. \"With this software, we bring Europe closer to establishing a presence of humans on the moon and, potentially, this would be a stepping stone towards Mars exploration or human presence on Mars,\" Steven Kay, the project's director, told Reuters. The new technology was put to the test in the otherworldly landscapes of Fuerteventura - one of Spain's Canary Islands - where GMV conducted field trials with the prototype in a part of the Earth that bears some resemblance to the lunar surface. By using signals similar to GPS from moon-orbiting satellites, LUPIN would allow rovers and astronauts to pinpoint their location on the moon in real time. Currently, navigating the Earth's largest natural satellite is difficult, as spacecraft on its surface have to rely on complex calculations and data relayed from Earth - which is neither quick nor precise. \"Communication depends on direct visibility with Earth or the use of relay satellites in lunar orbit, which create communicative shadow zones and latency times that hinder immediate decision-making,\" GMV said in a statement. The lack of real-time updates on changes in the moon's terrain caused by recent impacts or lunar dust movements also hinder ground trips on the satellite. The company wants to combine existing lunar cartography with information gleaned from moon-orbiting satellites targeting dark spots, such as the lunar south pole and the \"far side\", the area generally in shadow. \"We want these rovers to map the surface of the moon in a fast and safe way so that astronauts can return in a few years, work there and set up permanent bases,\" said GMV's head of strategy, Mariella Graziano.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - The Pentagon ordered military educational institutions to pull and review any books that promote what it called \"divisive concepts and gender ideology\" on Friday, in the latest move from President Donald Trump's administration against diversity, equity and inclusion. Since taking office in January, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News host, has eliminated diversity initiatives at the Pentagon, ended commemorations of identity month celebrations like Black History Month, and removed some books from the Naval Academy, including the memoir of celebrated Black author Maya Angelou. In a new memo, the Pentagon said that educational materials \"promoting divisive concepts and gender ideology are incompatible with the Department's core mission.\" It said the military would identify and sequester any such material, and then dispose of it after a review process. The memo said a temporary committee comprised of leaders, educators, and library professionals from across the military would identify the books and carry out the review. In an attachment, the memo listed a number of terms to use to help in searching for books, including \"diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI),\" \"anti-racism,\" and \"white privilege.\" DEI programs seek to promote opportunities for women, ethnic minorities and other traditionally underrepresented groups. Civil rights advocates argue such programs, generally backed by Democrats, are needed to address longstanding inequities and structural racism.

    "title": "Pentagon waiver looks like a Catch-22 to banned transgender troops",
    "content": "WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - So far, none of America's transgender troops who want to continue serving in uniform have applied for a waiver to the Pentagon's ban on their service, Reuters was told by each of the military services. The reason? Because it's impossible to qualify, transgender troops say. Reuters was first to report on Thursday aPentagon memooutlining its plans to start kicking out transgender servicemembers next month, unless they elect to voluntarily leave on their on own beforehand. For transgender servicemembers carrying out critical missions, from flying combat helicopters to serving on warships overseas, there has been a lot of interest in any legal strategy to continue in uniform. The Pentagon has said waivers would be granted \"provided there is a compelling government interest in retaining the service member that directly supports warfighting capabilities.\" But the qualifications for a waiver look impossible to comply with, allowing only individuals who meet the following qualifications, laid out in a Pentagon memo from February: * \"The service member has never attempted to transition to another sex.\" * \"The service member demonstrates 36 consecutive months of stability in their sex.\" \"As far as I know, no such transgender service member exists,\" said one transgender service member, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Pentagon referred Reuters back to its memo on the qualifications when asked for comment. Nicolas Talbott, a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army reserve, said it was impossible to apply for a waiver under the Pentagon's list of exemptions since he had fully transitioned. \"It's wild that anybody would think that was something that was actually within the realm of possibility for us to do,\" Talbott told Reuters. Jennifer Levi, senior director of transgender and queer rights at GLAD Law, an advocacy group, said the list of exemptions essentially meant there was no waiver. \"It doesn't make sense to file a waiver because they can't serve in their birth sex, because they're transgender people,\" Levi said. There were no waivers requested from the Air Force or Space Force, while the Army, Navy and Marine Corps said they were also not aware of any service members who had applied for an exemption. As of late last year, there were 4,240 U.S. active-duty and National Guard transgender troops, officials have said. Transgender rights advocates have given higher estimates. The Pentagon said on Thursday about 1,000 service members who have self-identified as being diagnosed with gender dysphoria will begin the voluntary separation process. A poll from Gallup published this in February said 58% of Americans favored allowing openly transgender individuals serving in the military, but the support had declined from 71% in 2019. The Pentagon's ban is just one of a series of steps the Trump administration has taken to curb transgender rights. Trump issued an executive order on his first day in office on January 20 stating that the U.S. government will recognize only two sexes, male and female, and that they are not changeable. But Trump's efforts to end transgender rights in the military were a special focus on his election campaign. In the executive order barring transgender troops, theWhite House saidthat a man identifying as a woman was \"not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.\" A former Fox News host, Hegseth has embraced conservative stances on this and other culture war issues, including eliminating diversity initiatives at the Pentagon. Speaking on Tuesday, Hegseth told a conference hosted by U.S. special operations forces: \"No more pronouns, no more climate-change obsessions, no more emergency vaccine mandates, no more dudes in dresses.\"",

    "content": "May 9 - The New England Patriots are without their defensive coordinator at rookie minicamp, as Terrell Williams is away from the team dealing with a \"medical condition,\" head coach Mike Vrabel and Williams told reporters Friday. \"I came back home here to Detroit, for spring break, and had a little medical scare. I mean, it wasn't a little medical scare. It was a medical scare,\" Williams said via video conference call. \"Since then, per doctor's orders, I've kind of stayed here, in Detroit, and been handling that.\" Neither Williams nor Vrabel went much further into the specifics of the health scare, though Williams said he \"ignored doctors\" over the past several years and said, .\".. when there's things that you can prevent and you don't prevent them, well, that's just not being smart.\" ESPN reported Friday that Williams has been absent from the team for approximately a month. Williams, 50, has been in touch with players and the coaching staff via Zoom during his absence. \"I've been in constant communication with him daily,\" said Vrabel. \"Terrell's eager to get back, and we're excited to get him back.\" Williams is in his first season as defensive coordinator with the Patriots in Vrabel's first season at the New England helm. He was on Vrabel's staff with the Tennessee Titans from 2018-23, finishing that tenure as the assistant head coach and defensive line coach. Williams coached the defensive line for the Miami Dolphins (2015-17) and then-Oakland Raiders (2012-14) after stints as an assistant at Texas A&M, Purdue, Akron and other schools. In his absence, some of Williams' responsibilities are being handled by inside linebackers coach Zak Kuhr, who was a New York Giants defensive assistant last season. Kuhr also spent time with Vrabel in various positions with the Titans from 2020-23. \"Zak has great knowledge of what we've done in the past, with me and this system, and with Terrell,\" Vrabel said. Williams also sang the praises of Kuhr, who he says he communicates with daily. \"Zak Kuhr has done an unbelievable job while I've been away. He's an unbelievably smart guy,\" Williams said. \"I think he's going to be a superstar in this league, smart and more than anything, I think that he has the ability to connect with players. .... So really, I think the defense is in good, good hands.\" Vrabel and Williams were noncommittal about when Williams could return to the team in person. \"I had a health scare, but I also want to make it clear that I'm away from the building, but I'm not away from the team,\" Williams said. \"Hopefully I'll be able to get back soon and just be in the building and be around everyone.\" --Field Level Media",

    "title": "Ex Fed's Warsh highlights a path to lower rates, takes a fresh dig at the Fed",
    "content": "Palo Alto, California May 9 (Reuters) - Kevin Warsh, an apparent frontrunner to be U.S. President Donald Trump's pick to be the next chair of the Federal Reserve, on Friday suggested a possible pathway to the lower policy rates that Trump has repeatedly pressed the current Fed Chair Jerome Powell to deliver, and delivered a fresh dig at the Fed's conduct of monetary policy. A large and often growing Fed balance sheet can work at cross-purposes with the Fed's main policy lever of setting short-term borrowing rates, Warsh told a monetary policy panel at Stanford University's Hoover Institution, but \"if the printing press could be quiet, we could have lower policy rates.\" Warsh served as Fed Governor from 2006 until 2011, when he quit because he opposed the Fed's continued balance sheet expansion as central bank overreach that encouraged the expansion of the nation's debt. The Fed is currently reducing its balance sheet. On Friday, Warsh offered an added criticism of the Fed, saying there is no \"cruel choice\" between the Fed's two objectives of stable prices and full employment, a reference to the idea long prevalent among many central bank policymakers that the cost of bringing down inflation is harm to the job market. \"What it means is, we don't have to push the unemployment rate up to get the inflation rate to fall,\" Warsh said on the sidelines of the conference. \"At the Fed, when they talk about how we get inflation down, what they really mean is, how do we get the unemployment rate up ... we need to throw people out of work to get the inflation rate to come down, which is nonsense. But that's embedded in economic thinking, including at the Fed.\" The idea that a \"cruel choice\" is \"nonsense\" is actually largely consistent with how the Fed has conducted policy over the last several years, as it brought inflation down from 40-year highs without pushing the unemployment rate above the rate that most economists feel is consistent withfull employment, opens new tab. Powell has repeatedly said he does not feel the current labor market is asource of inflation, suggesting that crushing the job market would do little to lower inflation. Warsh made his remarks at a conference and an institution steeped in Bush-Reagan Republicanism, now out of favor as Trump and his ideas have come to dominate the party. The conference was convened in part to celebrate John Taylor, a Bush economic adviser and author of one of the most famous monetary policy rules; Condoleezza Rice, Bush's Secretary of State, spoke on Thursday. Warsh himself was a Bush appointee to the Fed but also has close family ties to Trump through his wife - the daughter of Trump's former donor Ronald Lauder. He shared the stage on Friday with Fed Governor Christopher Waller, a Trump appointee who has also been mentioned as a possible candidate for Fed chair. Waller has said he's prepared to lower rates swiftly should tariffs drive a slowdown in the economy and send the unemployment rate upward. Asked what the Fed should do now, if its inflation and employment mandates come into tension, Warsh demurred. \"Well, that's a longer discussion,\" he said, heading back into the conference to hear the next speakers.",

    "title": "Exclusive: China buys Canadian, Australian wheat as heat hits crop, traders say",
    "content": "HAMBURG/CANBERRA/PARIS, May 9 (Reuters) - Chinese buyers bought between 400,000 and 500,000 metric tons of wheat from Australia and Canada in recent weeks, traders said, as heat threatens to damage crops in China’s agricultural heartlands. China is the world's top wheat grower and also imports large amounts of grain when domestic supply falls short of demand. Earlier this week, Henan province, which grows about a third of China's crop, issued a risk warning as hot, dry weather threatened the wheatgrowing in its fields. Chinese buyers have purchased four or five 55,000-ton shipments of wheat from Australia for delivery in July or August and around 200,000 tons from Canada, sources at two major trading firms in Australia said. The wheat is of milling quality. The bookings from Australia were the first made by China from the country since last year, said one of the traders. COFCO, the state-owned Chinese firm that handles most of the country's wheat imports, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China has in recent years been one of the world's biggest wheat importers, buying in around 11 million tons worth $3.5 billion in 2024. Australia and Canada are typically its biggest suppliers. But shipments slowed sharply after China reaped large wheat and corn harvests last year and have since remained low. Chinadelayed or redirectedshipments from Australia earlier this year and imported less than a million tons of wheat in the seven months to March 31, Chinese customs data accessed through Trade Data Monitor show. One of the sources said their company had lowered its forecast of Chinese 2025 wheat production by around 5 million tons but there was no guarantee that more purchases would follow because China has large wheat inventories. \"China is well self-sufficient in feed grains this crop year with heavy stocks,\" said Rod Baker, an analyst at Australian Crop Forecasters in Perth, adding that faltering economic growth in China was also depressing demand for grains. Talk of Canadian wheat sales to China has echoed around agricultural business circles in Winnipeg, Canada's grain industry capital, according to traders. Few concrete details on the sales have emerged. Chinese buyers would have avoided buying U.S. wheat due to tariffs and the trade war between Washington and Beijing, one trader said. China in the past has been a top destination for U.S. wheat sales. The drop-off in Chinese imports earlier in the current 2024/25 season had contributed to subdued international wheat prices, with benchmark futures in Chicago still near a four-year low touched last July. Along with weather risks to China's upcoming harvest, attractive prices may have lured Chinese importers back into the market as the 2025/26 season approaches, traders said. Chinese importers also booked a large amount of barley, according to traders. Some said that six panamax bulk carriers carrying around 360,000 tons of French or Ukrainian new-crop barley had been sold for delivery in July or August, with others putting the volume much higher at around 1 million tons, also for shipment this summer. \"Chinese wheat and barley import buying has been very quiet in the past year and these are the first major deals I have seen in many months,\" a German trader said. Feed barley purchases with optional origin were from Ukraine or France. The deals were done at a price of around $250-$254 a tonne delivered to China, one trader said.",

The result lifted Milan to eighth on 60 points, three behind Juventus in fourth, who will face sixth-placed Lazio, also on 63 points, on Saturday. Bologna sit seventh with 62 points. The match acted as a thrilling dress rehearsal for Wednesday’s Coppa Italia final, where the two sides will face off once more at the iconic Stadio Olimpico in Rome. With the win, Milan have earned 22 points from losing positions this season — only Atletico Madrid have a higher total, with 23, across the big five European leagues. Milan were dealt an early scare when defender Fikayo Tomori took a nasty knock in the opening minutes, crashing head-first into the back of a Bologna player. The English defender looked visibly dazed and was forced off shortly after, seemingly struggling with a potential head injury. The hosts had the momentum in the first half, with both Pulisic and Luka Jovic carving out chances, but they could not find the breakthrough. Bologna remained dangerous on the counter, yet the sides went into the break goalless. Riccardo Orsolini took charge four minutes after the break, cutting in from the right and drilling a low shot into the corner to put Bologna in front. Gimenez brought Milan level in the 73rd minute, latching onto a diverted cross from Pulisic and, left unmarked in the box, he slotted home with calm precision. Pulisic then completed the turnaround for Milan with 11 minutes remaining, capitalising on a blocked shot that fell into his path while Gimenez scored Milan's third in stoppage time.",

    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday will sign a proclamation restoring commercial fishing access to a marine national monument off New England, according to a White House official. The move is aligned with the Trump administration's efforts to cut regulations it believes are burdensome to businesses and economic activity. The proclamation will reopen the nearly 5,000-square-mile (13,000-square-kilometer) Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, which was designated by former President Barack Obama in 2016 to protect species including deep-sea corals, sea turtles and whales. Trump opened the monument to fishing during his first term in 2020, but that was reversed by former President Joe Biden in 2021. The decision supports fishing communities, economic activity and jobs, the White House official said. A recent aerial survey of the monument by the New England Aquarium, supported by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, found over 600 animals, including a humpback whale calf and bottlenose dolphin calves, the group posted on Facebook on Friday. Peter Auster, research professor emeritus of marine sciences at the University of Connecticut, said the monument serves as an important reference site for understanding how human activity in the ocean affects marine life. “Without protected areas like this that exclude commercial scale activities, we have no measure of how human uses elsewhere at sea impact biodiversity,” Auster said. The monument is the second Trump has opened to fishing since his second term started in January. On April 17 hesigned an orderopening 400,000 acres of the Pacific Remote Islands Marine National Monument to commercial fishing. The administration's regulatory freezeinjected chaos and uncertaintyinto the nation's $320 billion fishing industry this spring, when it delayed the opening of some East Coast fisheries and led to overfishing of Atlantic bluefin tuna, Reuters has previously found.",

The White House said in a statement that the \"President of the United States has the authority to determine what is a national emergency, not state attorneys or the courts. President Trump recognizes that unleashing American energy is crucial to both our economic and national security.” Trump, a Republican,declareda national energy emergency on his first day in office, claiming the development and production of energy and critical minerals failed to meet the country's needs. Trump directed the leadership of government agencies to use emergency powers to speed up permitting and remove obstacles to energy production. U.S. energy production isnear record levels, although U.S.power demandis growing for the first time in decades due to the development and adoption of AI. The price of crude oil <CLc1> has fallen around 20% from a year ago and nearly 50% from a recent peak in 2022. Emergency powers allow presidents to tap into special authorities, which is often used in times of crisis. Trump declared a national emergency during his first term to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. Since he took office in January, Trump has declaredillegal immigrationa national emergency to speed up construction of detention space and a wall on the southern border with Mexico. His use of a national emergency to imposetrade tariffswas nearly terminated by a bipartisan vote in the Senate.",

    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - S&P Global affirmed Israel's long- and short-term foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings at \"A/A-1\" and warned that prolonged or intensified military conflict could negatively impact its economic, fiscal and balance of payments performance. Israel's resumed military operations in Gaza, along with ongoing military activities in neighboring Lebanon and Syria, continue to elevate security risks for the country, the ratings agency said on Friday. S&P expects Israel's GDP growth to recover to 3.3% this year, driven by stronger investment and consumption, despite potential impacts from higher U.S. tariffs. Given that two-thirds of Israel's exports to the U.S. are services — primarily in the information and communication technology sector, which are not subject to import tariffs — the direct hit to the Israeli economy is expected to be moderate. According to the Bank of Israel, the economy is projected to grow 3.5% this year, with budget deficit expected to be 4.2% of GDP, down from 6.9% in 2024, easing pressure on the country's credit rating. The central bank, however, warned last month that conditions remained exceptionally uncertain because of the war and the global trade environment and as a result, Israel's risk premium has increased considerably. S&P affirmed the country's outlook at \"negative\".",

    "content": "May 9 - The Vegas Golden Knights are not yet in must-win territory, but they can ill afford another loss when they visit the Edmonton Oilers for Game 3 of their Western Conference semifinal series on Saturday. The Golden Knights are down 2-0 in the best-of-seven series, having dropped both games at home to start the set. \"Take the good, look at the bad, and be ready,\" Vegas captain Mark Stone said of his team's situation. \"We've got to win a game on Saturday night.\" Teams that win the first two games of a best-of-seven series when starting on the road own an all-time series record of 88-22 (.800) in Stanley Cup playoffs. The Golden Knights, who won the Pacific Division in the regular season, have a big trend to buck after dropping a back-and-forth 5-4 overtime clash on Thursday. Edmonton erased a deficit in an NHL-record sixth consecutive victory -- despite staking itself a 4-2 lead early in the third period, watching it dissolve and recovering with Leon Draisaitl's overtime winner. \"We were much better than in Game 1 and we're going to have to be better if we expect to win this series. Keep progressing in that direction,\" Vegas coach Bruce Cassidy said on Friday. \"When you go through a series, that pendulum can swing if you stay with it. That's the message.\" There was no update on the status of defenseman Brayden McNabb, who left the game in overtime after being tripped by Edmonton's Viktor Arvidsson and sent crashing into the boards. Vegas forward Nicolas Roy will have a hearing and possibly face a suspension for his cross-check to the face of Trent Frederic. Roy received a major penalty and game misconduct for the play in overtime. \"Very atypical of Nic, but they called it and it was the right call,\" Cassidy said. \"We'll see what comes of it.\" The Oilers are in the driver's seat to reach the conference final for the second consecutive year and third time in four seasons. However, they know how quickly a series can change. After all, they lost the first two games of their opening-round meeting with the Los Angeles Kings before rattling off four consecutive wins. Edmonton already feels fortunate to have claimed Thursday's clash. \"Not pretty at all,\" Oilers captain Connor McDavid said. He added: \"Not our group's best, but we found a way.\" In Edmonton's favor has been the team's depth. Unlike past playoff runs, including last year's trip to Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final, the Oilers are receiving offensive production throughout the lineup. Sure, the overtime winner was by Draisaitl and set up by McDavid -- a classic example of what Edmonton's dynamic duo can achieve when a game is on the line -- but the supporting cast has been a big part for a team that won by superior five-on-five play in the first two games of this series. \"The fact we lost the special teams battle in both games and came out with both wins, that's something I wouldn't have expected,\" Edmonton coach Kris Knoblauch said on Friday. Now to see whether the Oilers can gain a stranglehold on the series. \"We're just building and building our game,\" McDavid said. \"I feel like our best is still coming, and I'd hope to see it at home here. ... It means nothing if we're not ready to roll for Game 3.\" --Field Level Media",

Hagan, a former senior associate athletic director at the university, also is prior provincial, the leader of Augustinian friars at Villanova. Leo, who once led the world's Augustinians as prior general, is the first pope from that order. Hagan said the pope, whom he has known for 27 years, has the spirit of St. Augustine of Hippo, a North African bishop of the fourth and fifth century. \"And what I mean by that is veritas, unitas, caritas would be the core values,\" he said, referring to the Augustinian university's Latin motto that translates as \"truth, unity and love.\" The pope's intelligence, compassion,capacity for language, and ability to immerse himself in different cultures would help him in his mission, Hagan added. \"He has a certain ability to relate and connect with people that I think the world is going to really appreciate,\" he said. Students and faculty alike are savoring the moment. Classmates at a watch party at St. Rita's Hall, a building at the heart of campus named for a 15th-century Augustinian nun, eyedwhite smoke risingfrom the Sistine Chapel. Other students were taking a final exam in engineering when their professor announced the news on Thursday. Evening mass in the campus's iconic St. Thomas of Villanova Church became a celebration. Patty Rutter, 63, went into the library at the Inn at Villanova near campus on Thursday after she heard the news. Yearbooks dating to 1943 line the room in the inn's lobby. Rutter found the 1977 edition and paged through to a portrait of a serious-looking Prevost. \"There is no halo,\" joked Rutter, who works at the inn and is a Villanova student. The yearbook was soon removed from the library and placed in a safe, front desk clerk Kay Shockley said on Friday. It had suddenly become more valuable. Aleko Zeppos, 21, the newly elected student body president, said it had been an incredible week for Villanovans. \"Now our most notable alumni is not an NBA player,\" he said.

DePrinzio, who started that email with \"Dear Bob,\" said he got an immediate and friendly response. On Friday, he was planning an email offering \"prayerful support.\" \"I will lead with 'Your holiness,' and wait for him to say, 'You can call me Bob.'\" \"If that happens,\" he said, \"I might just pass out.\"",

    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a list on Friday of nearly 70 policy and regulatory guidance documents stretching back more than a decade that the agency plans to rescind. The announcement, which was not final, was the latest step in the administration'sradicalreorientationof the CFPB's work under President Donald Trump. The agency, created after the 2008 financial crisis to serve as a watchdog for American consumers against predatory business practices, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The documents rescinded provided policy and guidance oversight on matters as varied as debt collections in nursing homes, supervision of companies offering financial services to military servicemembers, discrimination in lending based on gender and sexual orientation and the publication of consumer complaint data. Some were policies and guidance issued under the prior Trump administration. In a notice posted Friday to the Federal Register's website, acting CFPB Director Russell Vought said the policy documents -- which offer interpretations of existing law and announce bureau priorities -- sometimes imposed illegal requirements on companies or simply increased the regulatory burden unnecessarily. Even where guidance documents were not necessarily improper, \"it is the Bureau's current policy to avoid issuing guidance except where necessary and where compliance burdens would be reduced rather than increased,\" Vought said. Republicans have long charged that the CFPB used such policy documents to avoid issuing regulations subject to public comment and legal challenges. The decision to scrap them is not yet final but the bureau will not enforce them during a pending review, according to Vought. In a statement, Brady Williams, legal counsel at Better Markets, which advocates for tougher financial oversight, said the CFPB's move implied it could dismantle its public-facing consumer complaint database. \"This is not just bureaucratic housekeeping. This is a calculated demolition of the tools consumers and advocates rely on to protect themselves from financial abuse,\" Williams said. Rob Nichols, head of the American Bankers Association, an industry lobby, hailed the move, saying in a statement he hoped it marked a \"turning point\" for the CFPB's approach to regulation. Before Trump fired former CFPB Director Rohit Chopra in February, the agency released a compendium of its guidance documents, noting that undera Supreme Court decision last year, courts, and not federal agencies, will have the final say in how arcane regulatory laws must be interpreted.",

    "content": "CHICLAYO, Peru, May 9 (Reuters) - The small city of Chiclayo in northern Peru was bustling with excitement on Friday, with businesses and locals sharing photos, memories and stories about its most famous former resident:Pope Leo XIV. The new head of the global Roman Catholic Church was born inChicago, but spent decades in Peru. He first arrived in 1985 as a young missionary in the mostly impoverished north, spending many of his formative years in the area. He became a Peruvian citizen in 2015 when he was appointed Bishop of Chiclayo, where he served until 2023. In the city, people remember him driving a white pick-up truck to help those affected by floods and heavy rains. He played tennis in his free time at the local Santo Toribio de Mogrovejo monastery, always greeted people outside his official residence and celebrated local holidays. \"Nothing could get in his way,\" Zury Castillo, secretary of the Chiclayo diocese, told Reuters, recalling then-Bishop Robert Prevost helping get oxygen to people during the COVID-19 pandemic and delivering supplies during the wet-season floods. \"He didn't need a driver, he brought bags of food and supplies and handed them out to people crossing through waters,\" added Castillo, who worked closely with the bishop. \"Later, when he became cardinal, we told him, 'the next step is pope'. He'd laugh and shake his head. But in our hearts something told us that after he left he'd become pope.\" Castillo recalled the pope enjoying local music and singing. He said Leo loved Peruvian Creole tunes and sang classic songs like \"Mi Perú\" and \"Alma, corazón y vida.\" On Thursday, a newspaper-stand in front of Chiclayo's cathedral was filled with magazines and broadsheets leading with news of the election of the new pope. \"The pope is Peruvian and misses ceviche,\" one headline read, a reference to a popular Peruvian dish. \"The pope is Chiclayano,\" read another. One nearby restaurant advertised what it said was the pope's favorite breakfast, a fried pork dish with potatoes and an onion relish called Frito Chiclayano. Next door, the Las Americas restaurant claimed the pope's favorite dish was their fried chicken chicharrón with homemade sauce. \"The pope ate here,\" read a blackboard outside. Rodrigo Cuoto, the restaurant's manager, said the then-Prevost would eat at the restaurant with other members of the clergy and was supportive of the city's youth, always offering guidance. \"He gave me a lot of advice,\" Cuoto said. \"Always do good, always be thankful, thank God and always be grateful.\" Cuoto said the pope was close to his grandmother, the founder of the restaurant, celebrating her birthday with her and her church friends. She even had his contact on WhatsApp, Cuoto said. \"Her happiness on hearing the news, she was beaming,\" Cuoto said. Marisela Roalcaba, a 73-year-old retiree outside the cathedral, commented with approval on how the new pope had spoken some Spanish during hisfirst speechand greeted \"his beloved Chiclayo\". \"As a Chiclayo native, he has given me great joy,\" she said. Inside a mass at the cathedral, Cecilia Pataz was delighted at the choice of pontiff, who replaced Argentine Pope Francis who died last month at the age of 88. \"(Prevost) was a very lovely father ever since he arrived in Chiclayo. We loved him a lot here and we still do,\" she said.",

Circuit Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw said the ban helps protect from the public from people who commit \"the most serious crimes\" and represent a \"special danger of misuse.\" The law was challenged by Steven Duarte, who had five convictions for nonviolent crimes, including vandalism and evading police, before being convicted and sentenced to 4-1/4 years in prison for violating the firearms ban. Neither the U.S. Department of Justice nor a federal public defender representing Duarte immediately responded to requests for comment. Friday's decision was issued by an 11-judge panel as courts around the country struggle to apply two recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions addressing Americans' right to bear arms. In New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, the Supreme Court in 2022expandedAmericans' 2nd Amendment rights to arm themselves in public, and required courts to look for historical analogues to justify new gun restrictions. Two years later, in U.S. v. Rahimi, the courtlimited the Bruen decisionby saying a \"historical twin\" wasn't required, as upholding a federal ban on gun ownership by people subject to restraining orders for domestic violence. Duarte had been a passenger in a red Infiniti that Inglewood, California, police pulled over in March 2020 for running a stop sign. Police saw him throw a handgun out the window, and while searching the car's interior found a loaded magazine that fit the handgun \"perfectly.\" A three-judge 9th Circuit panelstruck downthe firearms ban as applied to Duarte and threw out his conviction last May, before the Rahimi case was decided. Friday's decision overturned that ruling. Wardlaw said five federal appeals courts have upheld the firearms ban as applied to all felons, while two have found it might be unconstitutional as to some felons. In contrast, the federal appeals court in Philadelphia in Decemberfound it unconstitutionalas to a man who pleaded guilty to making a false statement to obtain food stamps. All 11 judges in Friday's decision voted to uphold Duarte's conviction, though three did so on procedural grounds. Circuit Judge Lawrence VanDyke, avocal criticof recent 9th Circuit gun control rulings, dissented from the court's constitutional analysis. He said the court is giving legislatures \"effectively unconstrained authority to disarm entire swaths of our citizenry,\" while leaving the 2nd Amendment \"inarguably the red-headed stepchild of the Constitution.\" The case is U.S. v. Duarte, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 22-50048.",

    "title": "Container shipping firms cull Asia-US service as Trump tariffs collapse trade",
    "content": "LOS ANGELES, May 9 (Reuters) - Major container shipping companies are suspending at least six scheduled weekly routes between China and the United States as President Donald Trump's punishingtariffson the world's top exporting country collapse trade, maritime consultants said. The ships on those routes have the combined capacity to deliver 25,682 40-foot containers stuffed with toys, tennis shoes, car parts and things U.S. manufacturers use to produce goods each week - or more than 1.3 million 40-foot containers a year, based on capacity data provided in customer advisories. The service cuts, coupled with cancellations of individual voyages, come as hulking container ship operators move to mitigate fallout from Trump's erratic trade policies. Policy makers, economists, and business owners have become increasingly hungry for information onoceantrade, responsible for 80% of the world's commerce, because it is a gauge of global economic health. \"This is not the precursor, it is the proof of a drop in economic activity,\" Simon Sundboell, CEO of Danish maritime data provider eeSea, said of the container vessel capacity reductions now underway. The route suspensions include scheduled weekly services operated by MSC, Zim and the Ocean Alliance that includes Cosco(601919.SS), opens new tab, Evergreen(2603.TW), opens new tab, CMA-CGM and Orient Overseas Container Line (OOCL)(0316.HK), opens new tab, Sundboell said. Four of the service cuts affect West Coast ports, one impacts the East Coast and one hits the Gulf Coast, he said. The container shipping companies culling those services either declined to comment or did not immediately respond. Maersk(MAERSKb.CO), opens new taband Hapag-Lloyd's(HLAG.DE), opens new tabGemini Alliance have not suspended services - even though both partners experienced significant tariff-related China to U.S.bookingcuts in April and have swapped out some ships forsmaller vessels. Representatives from the U.S. and China are meeting this weekend inSwitzerlandafter more than two months of stalemate over trade. Global shipping companies use service suspensions and cancellations of individual voyages, known as blank sailings, to shelter profits by ensuring they do not have more ships on the water than are needed by customers. That reduces unnecessary overhead costs and keeps supply and demand in balance, supporting competing off-contract spot rates. Blank sailings increased significantly after the COVID pandemic upended global trade in 2020 - and are part of why global container ship operators have been enjoying record profits. Major U.S. retailers likeAmazon.com(AMZN.O), opens new taband Walmart(WMT.N), opens new tab, which account for nearly half of global container trade, responded to Trump's145% tariffson China last month by pausing or cancelling factory orders after those import duties more than doubled the cost of goods made in China. Canceled, or blanked, individual voyages on the vital Transpacific route from Asia to North America surged from 9% in week ended March 30 to 24% in week ended May 4, maritime consultancy Drewry said in a podcast earlier this week. Drewry's data shows blank sailings reduced capacity on the Asia to West Coast North America routes by 20% in April and 12% so far in May. The cuts hit slightly harder on the North American East Coast, reducing 22% in April and 18% thus far in May, the consultancy said. MSC, the world's largest container ship operator, in April canceled 30% of its scheduled Transpacific voyages - more than any other container carrier, said Daniela Ghimp, project manager for ocean freight rate benchmarking at Drewry. The Premier Alliance, composed of Ocean Network Express (ONE), Hyundai Merchant Marine (HMM) and Yang Ming Marine Transportation, leads so far in May with a 20% blank sailing rate, Ghimp said. ONE declined comment, while HMM and Yang Ming did not immediately respond. The full effect of Trump's tariffs will likely be delayed until July, when overall U.S. container import volume could be down 25% or more from the year earlier, said John McCown, senior fellow at the Center for Maritime Strategy. \"Something's gotta give, and I believe either considerably more capacity will have to be culled, or spot rates will start to crash,\" said Alan Murphy, CEO of supply chain adviser Sea-Intelligence.",

The Richmond-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appealsruled 2-1, opens new tabfor the workers, reversing a lower court judge who said the claims were filed too late. The plaintiffs, a pair of naval architects, had alleged that a group of shipbuilders and nearly a dozen engineering consultancies violated federal antitrust law by agreeing not to compete with each other in the hiring of key employees. Circuit Judges James Wynn and DeAndrea Gist Benjamin said the plaintiffs had adequately alleged the shipbuilders created “an illicit no-poach agreement” that they deliberately tried to cover up, delaying when the plaintiffs learned about it. Huntington Ingalls in a statement said the lower judge's order dismissing the case \"was legally accurate and we will evaluate all our options and continue to vigorously defend this position.\" General Dynamics did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The defendants have denied wrongdoing. Attorneys for the plaintiffs declined to comment. The plaintiffs intheir lawsuitsaid the alleged “no poach” recruitment conspiracy cost workers hundreds of millions of dollars in lost compensation. The would-be class of engineers and architects was estimated in the \"tens of thousands.\" The companies had urged the appeals court to reject the lawsuit for being filed outside the four-year statute of limitations for antitrust claims. The plaintiffs countered that the companies “fraudulently concealed” the hiring and recruitment conspiracy, including avoiding any documentation of it. The 4th Circuit’s majority said the complaint “quotes multiple industry insiders who acknowledge the existence of the no-poach agreement.” In a dissent, Chief U.S. Circuit Judge Albert Diaz said the trial judge correctly ruled that the alleged “unwritten” hiring conspiracy was not an “affirmative” act of concealment that can overcome the four-year time bar for antitrust claims.

    "title": "Family creates AI video to depict Arizona man addressing his killer in court",
    "content": "CHANDLER, ARIZONA, May 9 (Reuters) - A simulation of a dead man created by artificial intelligence addressed his killer in an Arizona court this month, in what appears to be one of the first such instances in a U.S. courtroom. Made by his family, an AI-generated avatar of Christopher Pelkey spoke in Maricopa County Superior Court on May 1, as a judge prepared to sentence Gabriel Paul Horcasitas for shooting and killing Pelkey in a 2021 road-rage incident. \"It is a shame we encountered each other that day in those circumstances,\" the Pelkey avatar says in the video. \"In another life, we probably could have been friends.\" The Pelkey avatar appears in the video sporting a long beard and green sweatshirt against a white backdrop. He cautions at the start that he is an AI-version of Pelkey, which is apparent through the gaps in audio and slightly mismatched movement of his mouth. Pelkey, a U.S. Army veteran, was 37 at the time of the shooting. The video marked a novel use of AI in the legal system, which has viewed the rapidly growing technology with a mix of fascination and trepidation. Courts generally have strict rules on the types of information that can be presented in legal proceedings, and several lawyers have beensanctionedafter AI systems created fake cases that they cited in legal briefs. Pelkey’s relatives were given more leeway to present the AI-generated video to the judge at sentencing, given that it was not evidence in the case. Horcasitas, who was sentenced to 10.5 years in state prison, had already been convicted on manslaughter and endangerment charges. Pelkey’s sister Stacey Wales said she scripted the AI-generated message after struggling to convey years of grief and pain in her own statement. She said she was not ready to forgive Horcasitas, but felt her brother would have a more understanding outlook. “The goal was to humanize Chris, to reach the judge, and let him know his impact on this world and that he existed,” she told Reuters. Generative AI, Wales said, is “just another avenue that you can use to reach somebody.” Wales said she worked with her husband and a family friend, who all work in the tech industry, to create it. Harry Surden, a law professor at the University of Colorado, said the use of generative AI material in court raises ethical concerns, as others may seek to use those tools to play on the emotions of judges and juries. The content is a simulation of reality, not the verified evidence that courts typically assess, Surden said. “What we’re seeing is the simulations have gotten so good that it completely bypasses our natural skepticism and goes straight to our emotion,” he said.",

    "content": "NEW YORK/LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - MSCI's global equities index barely rose on Friday and the dollar lost ground as a U.S.trade dealwith Britain fueled guarded optimism for U.S. tariff negotiations with China and other countries. U.S. President Donald Trump pushed back against the idea that the UK deal could be a template for other trade negotiations. Traders await a meetingSaturdayin Geneva, Switzerland, between the U.S. Treasury Secretary and chief trade negotiator with China's economic tsar. Indiaoffered to slash its tariff gapwith the U.S. to less than 4% from nearly 13% now, in exchange for an exemption from \"current and potential\" tariff hikes, Reuters reported. Trump said setting 80% tariffs on Chinese goods \"seems right\". It was his first suggestion of an alternative to the 145% levies he has imposed. Signaling the U.S. is willing to make any cut on tariffs was incrementally positive, according to Matt Stucky, chief portfolio manager for equities at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management. \"With the Geneva meeting this weekend, there's a little bit of anxiety and certainly a fair amount of profit taking given the strength we've had,\" said Michael James, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities, adding that people wary of anything potentially negative coming from the meetings. \"We've all become accustomed in the last month to the impact negative and positive from any social media headlines coming from the White House.

For the week, the S&P 500 fell 0.5% while the Dow lost 0.2% and the Nasdaq slipped 0.3%. Incurrencies, the dollar was down on the day, but eyeing a weekly gain against major currencies, including the Swiss franc, yen and euro on optimism about upcoming U.S.-China talks. The dollar index , which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies including the yen and the euro, fell 0.28% to 100.37.

On Friday, bitcoin gained 0.58% to $103,224.04. Ethereum rose 6.71% to $2,331.16. U.S. Treasury yields were little changed, with thinner volume than usual and sentiment still uncertain, as investors looked ahead to talks between the U.S. and China.

    "title": "Bank of England cuts rates to 4.25% as it sees tariff hit to growth",
    "content": "LONDON, May 8 (Reuters) - (This May 8 story has been corrected to say two-thirds of the impact is due to the direct effect of tariffs on demand for UK imports, not because of weaker global growth, in paragraph 16) The Bank of England cut interest rates on Thursday to tackle the expected hit from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs but a surprise three-way split among policymakers cooled expectations that it might speed up future moves. The BoE's rate-setters voted 5-4 in favour of cutting borrowing costs by quarter of a percentage point to 4.25%. Two Monetary Policy Committee members, Swati Dhingra and Alan Taylor, voted for a bigger half-point cut. Chief Economist Huw Pill and Catherine Mann wanted to keep rates on hold. No economist polled by Reuters had expected any vote against a rate cut. Sterling rose and two-year borrowing costs jumped as markets saw a much reduced chance of another rate cut in June. Thursday's decision was the British central bank's first since Trump announced wide-ranging tariffs on April 2, which unleashed temporary market turmoil and prompted the International Monetary Fund to cut itsglobal growth forecasts. The BoE said it thought tariff increases by the U.S. and other countries would trim British economic growth and push down on inflation, but stressed the outlook was unclear. \"The past few weeks have shown how unpredictable the global economy can be. That's why we need to stick to a gradual and careful approach to further rate cuts,\" Governor Andrew Bailey said. The BoE has now cut interest rates by the same amount as the U.S. Federal Reserve since mid-2024 but by less than the European Central Bank due to concerns about high wage growth as well as the risk ofpersistently above-target inflation. \"The two votes from committee members to hold rates steady sent a more hawkish message to the market,\" said Matthew Landon, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. \"Beneath the hood, we still think that the conditions for cuts remain in place.\" The BoE said it had no pre-set path for rates. It also said the impact of global trade tensions \"should not be overstated\". \"Interest rates are not on autopilot. They cannot be,\" Bailey told a press conference. \"Instead, the MPC must continue to respond carefully to the evolving economic circumstances.\" For three of the five policymakers who voted for a quarter-point reduction, this week's decision would have been \"finely balanced\" without the escalation of trade tensions, the minutes showed. Bailey indicated to reporters he was among that group. Based on the situation as of April 29, the BoE estimated the U.S. tariffs would lower British inflation by 0.2 percentage points in two years' time and reduce the size of the economy by 0.3% after three years. Later on Thursday,Trump saidhe would scrap 25% tariffs on imports of British steel and lower tariffs on cars from 27.5% to 10%, the rate which will remain for most other goods imports. Bailey, speaking before details of the deal were public, said it would \"help to reduce uncertainty\". However, the BoE said about two-thirds of the damage it forecast to British growth was the direct impact of tariffs in reducing demand for British exports in the U.S. and elsewhere, while the remainder reflected the impact of trade policy uncertainty in lowering global growth. On Wednesday, Fed Chair JeromePowell highlighted ongoing uncertaintyabout the impact of trade policy on the economy as the U.S. central bank held off from a further rate cut. While investors still expect the BoE to lower interest rates close to 3.5% by year-end, June's meeting now looks much less likely to yield a cut - with the probability falling to under 20% from around 60% before Thursday's announcement. Two-year gilt yields rose around 7 basis points after the BoE announcement and finished the day 12 bps higher at a two-week high of 3.93% as investors digested the U.S. deal. Asked by CNBC television about the market reaction to the rate cut, Bailey said it reflected how the BoE had said there were still upside as well as downside risks to inflation. In a quarterly forecast update, the BoE trimmed its expectation for inflation this year, seeing it peaking at around 3.5%, lower than a previous forecast of around 3.75% though up from the latest official reading of 2.6% in March. It sees inflation back at its 2% target in the first quarter of 2027 - nine months earlier than it forecast in February. The central bank expects the economy to grow this year by 1%, a bit more than February's forecast of 0.75%, thanks to a strong end to 2024 and robust official data at the start of 2025 which pointed to 0.6% quarterly growth in the first quarter. However, it said the first-quarter growth bounce looked like a one-off and for 2026 it cut its growth forecast to 1.25% from 1.5%.",

    "content": "ORLANDO, Florida, May 9 (Reuters) - TRADING DAY Cautious stability World markets traded on a solid footing this week as the Trump administration struck what could bethe firstof\"dozens\"of trade deals in the coming weeks, and as investors cheered this weekend'sUS-China trade talks in Switzerland. The S&P 500 and Nasdaqare back where they were on April 2, recovering the 15% losses in the days immediately after 'Liberation Day' when Trump unveiled his reciprocal tariffs,Germany's DAX is at new highsand Japanese stocks sealed their best weekly winning streak in over two years. Sentiment was boosted by a sweeping raft ofstimulus measures from China, including interest rate cuts and liquidity injections. TheBank of Englandalso cut rates and the Bank of Japan looks to have put its tightening cycle on ice. While theU.S. Federal Reservedidn't ease policy, markets know where they are with it - stability amid uncertainty can be reassuring too. On the earnings side, 450 companies listed on the S&P 500 have reported first quarter results. Earnings growth is running at around 14%, although negative projections for the second quarter have outstripped positive forecasts by almost 50%, according to IBES/LSEG analysis. Caution reigns though, at least in U.S. markets. Despite the wave of trade optimism, Wall Street and Treasury yields ended little-changed on the week. Investors were also reminded of how erratic and unpredictable the U.S. administration is - President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance renewed theirattacks on Fed Chair Powell, and Trump said80% tariffson China \"seemed right\", a figure the White House later said he \"threw out there\". Once the dust settles and deals are reached, tariffs will be lower than those proposed on April 2, perhaps significantly lower. But the fact is, they will be significantly higher than they were before Trump entered office. As economist Phil Suttle notes, tariffs have yet to bite, but they will. He estimates the average effective U.S. tariff rate will settle around 22%, which would be a four-fold increase from when Trump took over. Goldman Sachs economists note that while the 'hard' data has been resilient, the economy is on the \"precipice of an activity slowdown\". So for investors, it depends on the starting point. Are you relatively bullish because tariffs won't be as high as looked likely on April 2, or relatively bearish because they will be much higher than before Trump? With uncertainty so high and visibility so low, the current interregnum might be appropriate. All eyes now turn to Geneva, where a U.S. delegation led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent will sit down for trade talks with a Chinese team led byeconomic tsar He Lifeng.

The billionaire Tesla CEO and owner of social media platform 'X' was brought into the Trump administration in January to great fanfare, pledging to take a chainsaw to federal spending and get the budget deficit down. Eventual cuts of $2 trillion were touted. It's safe to say his initial efforts have fallen short of those lofty goals, and Musk has taken has taken a step back from the limelight. As Republicans prepare tocomplete Trump's fiscal package next week, those aims are looking increasingly out of reach. The early days of the Trump 2.0 administration suggest spending has not been reigned in at all. Indeed, it is higher than it was under the Biden administration. Morgan Stanley economists this week said they expect the 2026 budget deficit to be 7.1% of GDP, up from 6.7% in 2025. That would be an increase of around $310 billion.

After the decision, the two companies sued CFIUS, which scrutinizes foreign investments for national security risks, alleging that Biden had prejudiced the committee's decision and violated the companies' right to a fair review. They argued Biden did so in 2024 by expressing opposition to the deal when he was running for re-election to win support from the United Steelworkers union in the swing state of Pennsylvania, where U.S. Steel is headquartered. The Biden administration had defended the review as essential to protecting security, infrastructure, and supply chains. In April, President Donald Trumpdirected CFIUS to take a fresh lookat the merger to help determine if \"further action\" is appropriate, raising hopes that the deal could gain an elusive green light.

Hard-right nationalist George Simion won the first round of the presidential ballot on Sunday, and an opinion survey earlier this week showed himleadingahead of the May 18 run-off vote against centrist Bucharest Mayor Nicusor Dan. Simion, 38,opposesmilitary aid to Ukraine, is critical of the EU leadership and says he is aligned with U.S. President Donald Trump's Make America Great Again movement. Analysts have said a Simion victory could isolate Romania, erode private investment and destabilise NATO's eastern flank, where Bucharest plays a key role in providing logistical support to Ukraine as it fights a three-year-old Russian invasion. In Bucharest on Friday, an estimated 15,000 people rallied, waving EU and Romanian flags and chanting, \"Russia, don't forget Romania is not yours\" and \"We want our country forward not backward.\" \"I was seriously thinking about taking out a loan for an apartment,\" said 26-year-old Petre, who declined to give his last name. \"But I don't know that I could do that if George Simion were president. \"Our EU membership brought us prosperity and security.\" In a televised debate on Thursday, Dan, 55, a two-term mayor of Bucharest running as an independent centrist on an \"Honest Romania\" ticket, fully backed EU plans to arm itself. In contrast, Simion suggested he would veto Brussels military aid to Ukraine while saying that Europe should depend on NATO for its own defence. \"It scares me that other people might not benefit from the same opportunities I have had,\" said 19-year-old student Alex, who has studied abroad under the EU's program for supporting education across Europe and said he will always be grateful for the friendships and connections it enabled. In the western Romanian city of Timisoara, protesters held a banner reading \"Better dead than fascist.\" \"Today, on Europe Day, we reflect on what Romania's 18 years of EU membership have meant for our country: greater opportunities, better infrastructure, and the chance to thrive in a united Europe,\" interim President Ilie Bolojan said on social media platform X.",

    "title": "Bank of England cuts rates to 4.25% as it sees tariff hit to growth",
    "content": "LONDON, May 8 (Reuters) - (This May 8 story has been corrected to say two-thirds of the impact is due to the direct effect of tariffs on demand for UK imports, not because of weaker global growth, in paragraph 16) The Bank of England cut interest rates on Thursday to tackle the expected hit from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs but a surprise three-way split among policymakers cooled expectations that it might speed up future moves. The BoE's rate-setters voted 5-4 in favour of cutting borrowing costs by quarter of a percentage point to 4.25%. Two Monetary Policy Committee members, Swati Dhingra and Alan Taylor, voted for a bigger half-point cut. Chief Economist Huw Pill and Catherine Mann wanted to keep rates on hold. No economist polled by Reuters had expected any vote against a rate cut. Sterling rose and two-year borrowing costs jumped as markets saw a much reduced chance of another rate cut in June. Thursday's decision was the British central bank's first since Trump announced wide-ranging tariffs on April 2, which unleashed temporary market turmoil and prompted the International Monetary Fund to cut itsglobal growth forecasts. The BoE said it thought tariff increases by the U.S. and other countries would trim British economic growth and push down on inflation, but stressed the outlook was unclear. \"The past few weeks have shown how unpredictable the global economy can be. That's why we need to stick to a gradual and careful approach to further rate cuts,\" Governor Andrew Bailey said. The BoE has now cut interest rates by the same amount as the U.S. Federal Reserve since mid-2024 but by less than the European Central Bank due to concerns about high wage growth as well as the risk ofpersistently above-target inflation. \"The two votes from committee members to hold rates steady sent a more hawkish message to the market,\" said Matthew Landon, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. \"Beneath the hood, we still think that the conditions for cuts remain in place.\" The BoE said it had no pre-set path for rates. It also said the impact of global trade tensions \"should not be overstated\". \"Interest rates are not on autopilot. They cannot be,\" Bailey told a press conference. \"Instead, the MPC must continue to respond carefully to the evolving economic circumstances.\" For three of the five policymakers who voted for a quarter-point reduction, this week's decision would have been \"finely balanced\" without the escalation of trade tensions, the minutes showed. Bailey indicated to reporters he was among that group. Based on the situation as of April 29, the BoE estimated the U.S. tariffs would lower British inflation by 0.2 percentage points in two years' time and reduce the size of the economy by 0.3% after three years. Later on Thursday,Trump saidhe would scrap 25% tariffs on imports of British steel and lower tariffs on cars from 27.5% to 10%, the rate which will remain for most other goods imports. Bailey, speaking before details of the deal were public, said it would \"help to reduce uncertainty\". However, the BoE said about two-thirds of the damage it forecast to British growth was the direct impact of tariffs in reducing demand for British exports in the U.S. and elsewhere, while the remainder reflected the impact of trade policy uncertainty in lowering global growth. On Wednesday, Fed Chair JeromePowell highlighted ongoing uncertaintyabout the impact of trade policy on the economy as the U.S. central bank held off from a further rate cut. While investors still expect the BoE to lower interest rates close to 3.5% by year-end, June's meeting now looks much less likely to yield a cut - with the probability falling to under 20% from around 60% before Thursday's announcement. Two-year gilt yields rose around 7 basis points after the BoE announcement and finished the day 12 bps higher at a two-week high of 3.93% as investors digested the U.S. deal. Asked by CNBC television about the market reaction to the rate cut, Bailey said it reflected how the BoE had said there were still upside as well as downside risks to inflation. In a quarterly forecast update, the BoE trimmed its expectation for inflation this year, seeing it peaking at around 3.5%, lower than a previous forecast of around 3.75% though up from the latest official reading of 2.6% in March. It sees inflation back at its 2% target in the first quarter of 2027 - nine months earlier than it forecast in February. The central bank expects the economy to grow this year by 1%, a bit more than February's forecast of 0.75%, thanks to a strong end to 2024 and robust official data at the start of 2025 which pointed to 0.6% quarterly growth in the first quarter. However, it said the first-quarter growth bounce looked like a one-off and for 2026 it cut its growth forecast to 1.25% from 1.5%.",

    "title": "Oil prices post weekly gains on US-China trade talk optimism",
    "content": "NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - Oil prices settled nearly 2% higher on Friday and notched their first weekly gains since mid-April as a U.S. trade deal with the United Kingdom turned investors optimistic ahead of talks between top officials from Washington and Beijing. Brent crude futures rose $1.07, or 1.7%, to settle at $63.91 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures advanced $1.11, or about 1.9%, to settle at $61.02. Week-over-week, both benchmarks gained over 4%. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said China should open its market to the U.S., and that an80% tariffon Chinese goods \"seems right,\" a day after he announced adeallowering tariffs on British car and steel exports, among other agreements with the United Kingdom. \"Energy markets - as bearish as they've been - are finally shaking off some of the pessimism and catching the broader market optimism that's showing back up as progress on trade relationships has begun,\" said Alex Hodes, oil analyst at brokerage StoneX. The UK agreement and Trump's comments on China have raised hopes for similar deals between Washington and Beijing. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was tomeetwith China's top economic official Vice Premier He Lifeng in Switzerland on May 10. Current U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports stand at 145%. \"While prohibitively high, you can't knock the math ... 80% is substantially less than 145%,\" Hodes wrote to clients. Chinese exports rosefaster than expectedin April while imports narrowed their decline, customs data showed on Friday, giving Beijing some relief ahead of the talks. Rising hostilities in the Middle East also boosted oil prices this week, Nikos Tzabouras, senior market analyst at trading platform Tradu, said. Israel's military said it had intercepted a missile launched from Yemen towards its territory, days after Oman mediated a ceasefire between the U.S. and Yemen's Houthis, who claimed responsibility for Friday's attack. Still, the outlook for oil prices remains uncertain and will largely depend on the trajectory of the U.S. economy, its trading policies and the enforcement of sanctions on Iran and Russia, said Marcus McGregor, head of commodities research for asset management firm Conning. On Thursday, the U.S. imposedsanctionson a third Chinese independent oil refinery for purchases of Iranian crude, ahead of a fourth round of nuclear talks in Oman this weekend. Keeping a ceiling to oil price gains this week was the planned increase to oil output by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, known collectively as OPEC+. However, a Reuters survey found that OPEC oil outputedged lower in Aprilas production declines in Libya, Venezuela and Iraq outweighed a scheduled increase in output. The survey was just enough to add an extra glimmer to markets already hopeful ahead of the U.S.-China trade talks, PVM analyst John Evans wrote to clients on Friday.",

    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - The number of measles cases in the United States has crossed 1,000 for the first time in five years, federal data showed on Friday, as the country battles one of its worst outbreaks of the childhood disease. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 1,001 measles cases in 31 jurisdictions, as of Thursday. The CDC count does not reflect the latest data from Texas, the epicenter of the current measles outbreak, where cases have increased by seven to a total of 709. Researchers have warned that the United States is at a tipping point for the return of endemic measles, a quarter century after the disease was declared eradicated in the country. Infections only previously surpassed the 1,000 mark in 2019 when the country reported 1,274 cases. \"I think we are still at risk of seeing these numbers at least stay steady, if not continue to increase over time,\" said Lisa Maragakis, senior director of infection prevention at Johns Hopkins Medicine. The outbreak in Texas, which has led to the deaths of two children and hundreds more being infected, is centered in a Mennonite community and has spread to neighboring states including New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas. The CDC said 13% of those infected with the disease this year have been hospitalized. There have been three confirmed deaths so far. There have been 14 outbreaks, defined as three or more related cases, reported in 2025, the CDC said. U.S. pediatricians and infectious disease experts say that the fight against rising measles cases nationwide is being hampered by a lack of forceful advocacy for vaccination by government health officials and by misleading statements about unproven treatments that confuse parents. The measles vaccine is 97% effective after two doses, according to the CDC.",

    "title": "NCAA rules committee proposes coach's challenges, transition to quarters",
    "content": "May 9 - The NCAA Men's Basketball Rules Committee proposed the integration of coach challenges on Friday, giving teams one per game to review out-of-bounds calls, basket interference and goaltending as well as determining if a defender was positioned in the restricted area underneath the basket. Under the proposal, coaches would need to have a timeout in order to request a challenge. If successful, coaches will receive another challenge. That is just one of several recommendations made to the NCAA Playing Rules Oversight Panel, which will review the proposals on June 10 to be implemented during the 2025-26 season. Another recommendation from the rules committee is to create a group to explore a potential change from halves to quarters, falling in line with the NBA, women's college basketball and other global leagues. The committee noted \"positive momentum\" existed to make the change but cited hurdles in doing so, such as restructuring media timeouts \"to accommodate commercial inventory.\" Hence the suggestion to create a working group to study the topic and provide a report at this time in 2026. Karl Hicks, the rules committee chairman and American Athletic Conference associate commissioner for basketball, said that the committee focused on improving gameflow toward the ends of games, which have seen an increased number of stoppages for official reviews. The proposal would essentially do away with required official reviews unless a coach challenges the call as challenges \"were deemed to be the most efficient way to accomplish this goal,\" Hicks said. Another proposal from the rules committee addressed continuation. The committee recommended that a player who \"ends his dribble\" as he traveled toward the basket and absorbs defensive contact \"would be permitted to pivot or complete the step the player is on and finish the field goal attempt.\" Overall, Hicks said, the committee aims to align college basketball with other levels of the sport. \"When I say other levels,\" Hicks said, \"that includes the high school level. Their rule is more liberal than our college rules when it comes to shooting the ball. Hopefully, we won't see as many officials waiving off baskets that will now be considered part of the shot.\" --Field Level Media",

Trump's order is meant to ease the burden on small businesses that do not have the same compliance resources as large corporations, according to a draft the official shared. The executive order would have agencies publicly post a list of regulatory violations that can trigger criminal charges, and guidance on the circumstances under which they would refer violators for prosecution. The order would discourage prosecutors from filing charges not on the lists, and charges that do not require prosecutors to prove the defendant had criminal intent. One such law has been used to prosecute executives for misbranded or adulterated food and drugs. The order would not apply to immigration or national security.

    "content": "NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - Ten-time All-Star Brittney Griner has recaptured her love for basketball after moving to the Atlanta Dream in a shock free agency move, the veteran center said on Friday. The former first overall pick built her career over 12 years with the Mercury and once appeared to be a permanent fixture in Phoenix, where she helped win the title in 2014 and was twice the WNBA's scoring champion. In a WNBA off-season full of blockbuster acquisitions, the 34-year-old Griner signing a one-year deal with the Dream earlier this year was perhaps the biggest shock to fans. But the three-time Olympic champion said it was exactly the move she needed. \"I was somewhere for a very long time and it's good to have a different change of pace, different outlook on everything. Definitely found the love for the game again being here,\" Griner told a press conference. The earliest sign of her fresh start came in the Dream's 80-70 pre-season win over the Washington Mystics on Wednesday. The 6'9\" Griner drained a three-pointer in her first possession, showing comfort with a shot she did not even attempt in her five seasons with the Mercury. She told reporters that newly-installed coach Karl Smesko was helping build her confidence from behind the arc. \"Started in training camp day one, and I already can tell the difference now. I definitely feel comfortable taking the shot,\" said Griner. \"Between coach and my teammates, they're just putting a lot of confidence in me to take them. And then also movement on the three-point line and not just being on the block as well.\" Griner has enjoyed terrific longevity in her career despite a 10-month detention in Russia three years ago for carrying vape cartridges containing cannabis oil through a Moscow airport. She was freed from a Russian penal colony in a high-profile prisoner exchange in December 2022 and named an All-Star only seven months later for the 2023 season, where she averaged 17.5 points, 6.3 rebounds and 2.2 assists per game.",

    "content": "DUBAI, May 9 (Reuters) - Iran has agreed to hold a fourth round of nuclear talks with the United States on Sunday in Oman, Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said on Friday, adding that the negotiations were advancing. U.S. PresidentDonald Trump, who withdrew Washington from a 2015 deal between Tehran and world powers meant to curb its nuclear activity, hasthreatened to bombIran if no new deal is reached to resolve the long unresolved dispute. Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, plans to attend the talks in Oman, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. Western countries say Iran's nuclear programme, which Tehran accelerated after the U.S. walkout from the now moribund 2015 accord, is geared toward producing weapons, whereas Iran insists it is purely for civilian purposes. \"The negotiations are moving forward, and naturally, the further we go, the more consultations and reviews are needed,\" Araqchi said in remarks carried by Iranian state media. \"The delegations require more time to examine the issues that are raised. But what is important is that we are on a forward-moving path and gradually entering into the details.\" Witkoff, in an interview with Breitbart News, said the Iranians had stated that they do not want a nuclear weapon and the United States will \"take them at their word\" on this point. \"If that’s how they feel, then their enrichment facilities have to be dismantled. They cannot have centrifuges. They have to downblend all of their fuel that they have there and send it to a faraway place — and they have to convert to a civil program if they want to run a civil program,\" he said. The fourth round of indirect negotiations, initially scheduled for May 3 in Rome, was postponed, with mediator Oman citing \"logistical reasons\". In a separate statement on Friday, Omani Foreign Minister Sayyid Badr Albusaidi said that after \"coordination with both Iran and the U.S.\", the fourth round of negotiations was set to take place on Sunday in Muscat. Araqchi said his plannedvisitto Qatar and Saudi Arabia on Saturday was in line with \"continuous consultations\" with neighbouring countries to \"address their concerns and mutual interests\" about the nuclear issue.",

    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - The American Bar Association on Friday extended the suspension of its law school diversity and inclusion requirement amid increasing pressure from the Trump administration to cancel the rule. The ABA’s Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar unanimously voted to extend the suspension of the rule — which requires law schools to demonstrate their commitment to diversity in recruitment, admissions and programming — through August 31, 2026. The council in a statement cited the shifting higher education landscape and litigation over President Donald Trump's executive orders as reasons to further suspend the diversity rule. \"In light of these developments, the council determined that extraordinary circumstances exist in which compliance with [the diversity standard] would constitute extreme hardship for multiple law schools, and that the standard should not be presently enforced,\" the statement reads. The council initiallysuspended that rule in Februaryafter Trump issued a series of executive orders meant to curtail diversity efforts in the government, the private sector and in higher education. Attorney General Pam Bondi in Marchwarnedthe ABA that its role as the federally recognized accreditor of U.S. law schools — which it has held since 1952 — could be revoked if it did not repeal the rule and scrap a planned revision of the standard, which she said discriminated based on sex and race. Trump in April signed anexecutive orderdirecting Education Secretary Linda McMahon to assess whether to suspend or terminate the ABA as the government’s official law school accreditor, citing its “unlawful ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ requirements,” as part of an executive order focused on reforming higher education accreditation. Attorneys general from 21 Republican-controlled states have alsowarnedthe ABA that its law school diversity rule is unlawful. State high courts in Texas and Florida have both said in recent weeks that they are reviewing their requirement that aspiring lawyers graduate from an ABA-accredited law school in order to sit for their bar exams, with the Florida justices citing the ABA’s former law school diversity and inclusion rule.

    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - Google agreed to pay $50 million to settle a lawsuit accusing the search engine company of systemic racial bias against Black employees. A preliminary settlement covering more than 4,000 Google employees in California and New York was filed on Thursday evening in the Oakland, California federal court, and requires a judge's approval. Plaintiffs in the proposed class action said Google has a \"racially biased corporate culture\" where management steers Black employees to lower-level jobs, pays them less, downgrades their performance ratings and denies them opportunities to advance. According to the complaint, Black employees comprised only 4.4% of Google's workforce and 3% of its leadership in 2021. The plaintiff April Curley, hired to expand outreach to historically Black colleges, said Google denied her promotions, stereotyped her as an \"angry\" Black woman, and fired her after six years as she prepared a report on its alleged racial bias. Managers also allegedly denigrated Black employees by declaring they were not \"Googley\" enough or lacked \"Googleyness,\" which the plaintiffs called racial dog whistles. Google, a unit of Mountain View, California-based Alphabet(GOOGL.O), opens new tab, denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle, and said it fully complied with all applicable laws. \"We strongly disagree with the allegations that we treated anyone improperly and we remain committed to paying, hiring and leveling all employees consistently,\" Google spokeswoman Courtenay Mencini said in an emailed statement on Friday. The lawsuitbeganin March 2022 after a regulator now known as the California Civil Rights Department started investigating Google's treatment of Black female employees. Lawyers for the plaintiffs may seek up to $12.5 million of the settlement fund in fees. On Monday, the lawyers dismissed related claims brought on behalf of job applicants, citing evidence they had gathered and Google's \"reasoned arguments.\" The case is Curley et al v Google LLC, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-01735.",

Ingle, 33, arrived for her second spell at Chelsea in 2018 from Liverpool and has since won several trophies including five Women’s Super League titles and three FA Cups. She has not played this season after suffering an ACL injury in a pre-season match against Feyenoord in September. \"I’m very proud to have lifted 11 trophies here and am grateful to have done that alongside teammates who are like family to me,\" Ingle said in a statement. Musovic arrived at Chelsea in early 2021 from Swedish side Rosengard and has since won 10 trophies including five WSL titles and two FA Cups. The 28-year-old stepped down from first-team duties in February after announcing she was pregnant and has decided not to renew her contract. \"We have created many memories together and I have grown so much as a person during my time at Chelsea. It’s why it’s difficult to leave, but also why I feel confident to begin something new,\" Musovic said.",

    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - U.S President Donald Trump fired the Librarian of Congress, Carla Hayden, in part over her commitment to diversity, the White House said on Friday. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the Trump administration believed Hayden wasn't serving the interests of American taxpayers, citing her advancement of diversity, equity and inclusion policies. \"There were quite concerning things that she had done at the Library of Congress in the pursuit of DEI and putting inappropriate books in the library for children,\" Leavitt told reporters at a press briefing on Friday. \"She has been removed from her position, and the president is well within his rights to do that,\" she added. Hayden, who was the first woman and first African American in the role, headed an office that has overall management responsibility for the library and sets out policy on its programs and activities. Democratic President Barack Obama appointed her in 2016 to a 10-year term in the role that needed Senate confirmation. The Library of Congress did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. The New York Times first reported the firing. Top Democrats in Congress criticized the move as Trump's latest politically-motivated purge. \"Donald Trump’s decision to fire Dr. Carla Hayden is the latest foray in his relentless campaign to dismantle the guardrails of our democracy and punish public servants who don't bend to his every will,\" top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer wrote. The House of Representatives minority leader, Democrat Hakeem Jeffries, called the firing unjust. \"There will be accountability for this unprecedented assault on the American way of life sooner rather than later,\" he said in a statement.",

    "content": "JAMMU, India/ISLAMABAD, May 9 (Reuters) - Blasts rang out across Indian Kashmir and the Sikh holy city of Amritsar in neighbouring Punjab state late on Friday, with the Indian military saying it was shooting down drones in the worst fighting with Pakistan in nearly three decades. The explosions in Amritsar - the first heard there in the three-day-old conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours - could mark a further expansion in the hostilities that havealarmed world powers. Projectiles and flashes were seen in the night sky above the Indian Kashmir city of Jammu. It was plunged into a blackout on the second night of blasts in the region's winter capital, officials and a Reuters journalist said. \"Drones have been sighted ... They are being engaged,\" said an Indian military official who asked not to be named. The Indian army said in a statement late on Friday that drones were sighted in 26 locations across a wide area of India's west and northwest from Kashmir and states bordering Pakistan to the edge of the Arabian Sea. Ten blasts were heard near the airport in the Indian Kashmir city of Srinagar and there were explosions in more locations in the contested region, other security officials added. There was no immediate comment from Pakistan. It had dismissed Indian accusations that it launched attacks on the same area on Thursday night. The old foes have been clashing since India struckseveral areasthat it described as\"terrorist infrastructure\"in Pakistan on Wednesday in retaliation fora deadly attackon Hindu tourists in Indian Kashmir last month. Pakistan denied Indian accusations that it was involved in the tourist attack. The two countries haveexchangedcross-border fire and shelling, and they have sent drones and missiles into each other's airspace. Around 48 people have been killed since Wednesday, according to casualty estimates on both sides of the border that have not been independently verified. The Indian army said on Friday a family was severely injured by an armed drone in Ferozepur in India's Punjab state near the Pakistani border. Tourists and villagers fled border zones, residents rushed tostockpile foodand people were told to stay indoors in Kashmir and beyond.

The relationship between India and Pakistan has beenfraught with tensionsince they gained independence from colonial Britain in 1947. The countries have fought three wars, two of them over Kashmir, and clashed many times. In Washington, the White House said U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio was in constant contact with the leaders of both countries and reiterated that President Donald Trump wants to see the conflict de-escalate. India responded with drones on targets in Pakistan and destroyed one air defence system, Indian Air Force officer Vyomika Singh told a media briefing. Pakistan Information Minister Attaullah Tarar had dismissed earlier Indian accusations of Pakistani attacks as \"baseless and misleading\" and said Pakistan had not carried out any \"offensive actions\". In Pakistani Kashmir, officials said heavy shelling from across the border killed five civilians, including an infant, and wounded 29 others in the early hours of Friday. The fighting is the deadliest since a limited conflict between the two countries in Kashmir's Kargil region in 1999. Sirens blared for more than two hours earlier on Friday in Amritsar, which houses the Golden Temple revered by Sikhs. Tourists fled the city by road as the airport was closed. \"We really wanted to stay but the loud sounds, sirens, and blackouts are giving us sleepless nights. Our families back home are worried for us so we have booked a cab and are leaving,\" said a British national who did not want to be named.

    "content": "May 9 - Alpine is emerging as a potential option for Formula One driver Sergio Perez for the 2026 season, according to a report from the U.K.'s Daily Mirror on Friday. ESPN reported a week ago that Perez was in talks with Cadillac about potentially joining as a driver when it becomes the 11th F1 team next season. Cadillac, however, has other options under consideration, per ESPN. Enter Alpine, which this week benched 22-year-old Jack Doohan for at least the next five weekends in favor of Franco Colapinto, 21. It also could be a landing spot for Perez should Alpine decide to part with both and go with a more experienced driver alongside Pierre Gasly next year. After the season finale in Abu Dhabi in December, Perez and Red Bull announced they were cutting ties despite Perez having two years left on his contract. After finishing second in the standings to teammate Max Verstappen in 2023, Perez struggled last season. He failed to win a race for the first time since 2019 and had only four podium finishes. (He had 20 over the two previous seasons.) Perez, 35, has been enjoying family time while away from racing. In 281 career races, Perez has six wins, 39 podium finishes and four top-five finishes in the standings. A majority of that success, including three of those top-five finishes, came in his four seasons with Red Bull. \"Everything happened really late in the season,\" Perez told F1.com. \"I wasn't really expecting it to happen.

They also recently renegotiated the contract of fellow running back Jerome Ford. \"I wouldn't rule anything out, but I would say it's probably increasingly unlikely,\" Berry told 92.3 The Fan on Friday morning. \"I'd say maybe a return is less likely, at least in the short term, with us right now.\" Berry added that \"we haven't necessarily been in strong communication after the draft.\" Chubb, 29, has played in only 10 games over the past two seasons due to knee and foot injuries. He rushed for 332 yards and three scores in eight starts in 2024. A four-time Pro Bowl selection and four-time 1,000-yard rusher, Chubb ranks third in franchise history with 6,843 rushing yards behind Pro Football Hall of Fame members Jim Brown and Leroy Kelly. Judkins led the national champion Buckeyes with 1,060 yards and 14 rushing touchdowns last season.

    "title": "Policy uncertainty fuels rise in U.S. government debt hedging",
    "content": "NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - The cost of insuring exposure to U.S. government debt has climbed noticeably over the past month and remains stubbornly high, as jittery investors brace for a looming U.S. borrowing-limit political debate as well as overall policy uncertainty. Spreads on U.S. credit default swaps (CDS) - market-based gauges of the risk of a sovereign default - widened to their highest since thedebt ceiling crisis of 2023in recent weeks. The size of the market and trading volumes have also increased recently, Barclays said in a note this week, in a sign that a product generally considered to be niche is garnering more investor attention. While years ago buying protection for a U.S. default was an unpopular trade, things have changed recently because of policy uncertainty in Washington, said Greg Peters, co-chief investment officer of PGIM Fixed Income. \"Now, with the debt ceiling and everything else going on, no one wants to be short that option,\" he said. U.S. sovereign CDS spreads have increased not just for short-dated maturities but across the curve, with one-year and five-year spreads at their highest since May 2023, when the U.S. was on the verge of a default because of political brinkmanship over the debt ceiling. On Friday, those spreads stood at 60 basis points and 56 basis points, respectively - a touch lower than in recent weeks but still significantly higher than in March, S&P Global Market Intelligence data showed. The rise in the protection costs has gained momentum after April 2, when U.S. President Donald Trump announcedsweeping tariffs, which in the following days sparked asharp selloffin the Treasury market, the bedrock of the global financial system. \"What you've seen since April 2 is a real rise in that risk premium,\" said Peters. After days of heavy selling, Treasuries rallied after Trump announced a 90-day tariff pause for most U.S. trading partners, a move likely prompted by the tariff-fueled selloff. Benchmark 10-year yields were last at 4.36%, about 20 basis points lower than the high they touched on April 11, the day tariffs were paused. Still, another key measure of risk embedded in Treasury bonds, which captures the premium investors charge for policy uncertainty, has remained elevated in recent weeks, according to New York Fed data. The U.S. government reached its statutory borrowing limit in January and began employing \"extraordinary measures\" to keep it from breaching the cap and risking a potential default. Barclays analysts said in a note this week the so-called X-date, when the government will no longer be able to pay all its obligations, will likely fall in late August or early September, but that an economic slowdown could put pressure on the Treasury's cash position and pull that date forward. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessentsaid earlier this weekthat the department was \"at the warning track\" in terms of exhausting remaining borrowing capacity under the federal debt ceiling, but vowed that the government would not default on its obligations. Investors held about $3.9 billion worth of active credit insurance contracts on U.S. government debt as of May 2, Barclays said, citing data from the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, a financial market infrastructure company, up from $2.9 billion at the beginning of the year. Over the past three months, credit insurance on U.S. government debt has been the 12th most-traded single-name CDS contract globally, with weekly trading averaging over $625 million, said Barclays.",

    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - Newcastle United supporters have expressed their concern at the Premier League club's decision on Friday to consult a section of the fanbase regarding their plans to change the club's iconic crest which has been in use for 37 years. Newcastle said its current crest was \"created in a different era\" and that its intricate design does not always \"translate well in today's digital world\". The club invited season ticket holders and members to share their views in what they described as an independently run survey, but Newcastle United Supporters Trust has reservations about the survey. \"The survey is framed in an incredibly leading manner throughout and it is hard to see how any meaningful fan engagement or reliable conclusions can be drawn from it,\" it said in a letter to club CEO Darren Eales. The trust also pointed to a clause in the Football Association's rules which states that a club must be in a position to prove that the majority of its supporters are in favour of a material change to its club crest prior to making any such change. \"As it stands, the survey is not able to provide information on whether the majority of our supporters are open to the idea of making a material change,\" it added. \"To comply with FA rules, we strongly urge you as a club to provide a new survey, written in a neutral tone and to include an option for supporters to indicate that they do not wish to pursue any change at all.\" The current crest, which has been in use since 1988, has elements from the city's Coat of Arms like the castle, the demi-lion, the two seahorses on the side and a pennon. \"As the crest is a recognised Heritage Asset and a vital symbol that unites our city, we simply ask that the consultation process strictly adheres to FA guidance,\" the trust said.",

    "content": "WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - The Trump administration dismissed three Democrats on the five-member Consumer Product Safety Commission, a White House official confirmed Friday. The three Democratic commissioners said the firings were illegal. The CPSC issues product recalls to address safety concerns across a wide range of areas to protect consumers from defective and dangerous products. Asked about the CPSC firings and whether the administration cared about keeping unsafe toys and cribs off the market, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters at a briefing: \"He has the right to fire people within the executive branch.\" The CPSC works with consumers and companies to find hazards. It inspects products, writes safety rules and will go to court if companies do not ensure safe products. Richard Trumka, one of the Democratic commissioners fired by the Trump administration, said members ofElon Musk'sDOGE team on Thursday visited CPSC to join as detailees to the agency. Trumka said he declined \"because if these people are allowed in to govern our agency, they will gut it and the result will turn back the clock on product safety.\" He said he was supported by the other Democrats on the commission and the White House opted to seek to fire him. Trumka said the firing was illegal because they can only be removed for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office but not for any other cause. His term does not expire until October 2028. \"The president would like to end this nation’s long history of independent agencies, so he’s chosen to ignore the law,\" Trumka said. Democratic Commissioner Mary Boyle noted that the commission last week backed a proposed standard to add safety protections to dangerous lithium-ion batteries, noting that faulty batteries in ebikes, e-scooters, and other micromobility devices have caused intense, rapidly spreading deadly fires. This is the latest in a string of firings by the White House. On Monday, the White House dismissed Alvin Brown, the vice chair of the National Transportation Safety Board.

The oil and gas rig count, an early indicator of future output, fell by six to 578 in the week to May 9. , , Baker Hughes said this week's decline puts the total rig count down 25, or 4% below this time last year. Baker Hughes said oil rigs fell by five to 474 this week, their lowest since January, while gas rigs were unchanged at 101. In the Gulf of Mexico, drillers cut three rigs, bringing the total count down to nine, the lowest since September 2021. In the Denver-Julesburg (DJ)-Niobrara shale in Colorado and Wyoming, Nebraska and Kansas, drillers cut one rig, reducing the count to 5, the lowest since January 2021. In the Permian shale in West Texas and eastern New Mexico, the nation's biggest oil-producing shale basin, drillers cut two rigs, leaving 285 rigs, the lowest since December 2021. In New Mexico, drillers cut four rigs, bringing the total down to 96, the lowest since April 2022. The oil and gas rig count declined by about 5% in 2024 and 20% in 2023 as lower U.S. oil and gas prices over the past couple of years prompted energy firms to focus more on boosting shareholder returns and paying down debt rather than increasing output.

That increase in production, however, was lower than the EIA's outlook in April due to lower oil price forecasts as U.S.tariffsincrease the chances of weaker global economic growth and oil demand. On the gas side, the EIA projected an 88% increase in spot gas prices in 2025 would prompt producers to boost drilling activity this year after a 14% price drop in 2024 caused several energy firms to cut output for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic reduced demand for the fuel in 2020. The EIA projected gas output would rise to 104.9 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2025, up from 103.2 bcfd in 2024 and a record 103.6 bcfd in 2023.

PresidentTrumpsaid that an 80% tariff on Chinese goods \"seems right\" as representatives prepared for weekend talks to contain a trade war between the world's two largest economies. Additionally, on the geopolitical front,India and Pakistanaccused each other of launching new military attacks, using drones and artillery for the third day in the worst fighting between the nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours in nearly three decades. \"Obviously, the overall continued uncertainty in regards to tariffs remains probably the most significant underpinning behind gold,\" said David Meger, director of metals trading at High Ridge Futures. \"We're not quite as favourable towards gold as we have been over the course of the past several months.

Here is a quick rundown. The Vatican, despite the late Pope Francis' cost-cutting efforts and financial management reforms,faces an 83-million-euro($94.22 million) budget shortfall, two knowledgeable sources have told Reuters, and a much larger funding gap in its pension fund. The pension shortfall was estimated to total some 631 million euros by the Vatican's finance czar in 2022. There has been no official update to this figure, but several insiders told Reuters they believe it has ballooned. While the total number of Catholics, as measured by the number of baptised, keeps increasing and has surpassed the 1.4 billion mark, mostly thanks to growth in Africa, Church attendance and priestly vocations are dwindling in Europe. In Germany, the EU's most populous nation, the national bishops' conference reported earlier this year that only 29 new priests had been ordained in the country in 2024, an historic low. They also said around 321,000 German Catholics had left the Church that year. The total number of Catholics in Germany, whose population of 83 million was once about half Catholic, is now under 20 million. Under Francis, tensions between traditionalists and modernisers erupted over whether the Church should be more welcoming towards the LGBT community and divorcees, and let women play a greater role in church affairs. Francis did not formally change church doctrine, but opened the door to communion for divorcees and blessings for same-sex couples, although he did not allow a relaxation of priestly celibacy rules or the ordination of women deacons. The debate over whether toconsolidate, expand or roll backthese reforms is likely to continue in the coming years, if not decades, forcing the new pope into some sort of balancing act between opposing demands. The new pope is destined to continue grappling with the scandal of clerical sex abuse and its cover up, which has dogged the global Catholic Church for at least three decades, seriously undermining its standing. Francis and his predecessor Benedict XVI committed themselves to a policy of zero tolerance, but their reforms have deliveredat best partial results, with uneven implementation across different continents. Argentine Francis, the first pope from the so-called Global South, was not afraid to use his moral pulpit to ruffle Western feathers. He spearheaded a controversial Vatican deal with China on the appointment of bishops, hadfraught relations with Israelover the war in Gaza, and at times appeared to urge Ukraine togive upon its war of defence against Russia. He was a vocal campaigner for action on climate change and a critic of tough European and U.S. immigration policies, putting himself atodds with U.S. PresidentDonald Trump after he called Trump's plans to deport millions of migrantsa disgrace. Will the new pope be willing to continue in the same vein? ($1 = 0.8809 euros)",

    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - Shares of Expedia(EXPE.O), opens new tabfell 7.5% on Friday, after the online travel-booking platform missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue due to weak demand in the United States. Expedia joins its peers as the travel industry braces for a slowdown ahead of the peak summer season, with economic uncertainty — driven by the ongoing tariff war and elevated interest rates — weighing on consumer spending. At the end of April, hotel operator Hilton(HLT.N), opens new tabcut its annual forecastfor room revenue growth, and vacation rental company Airbnb(ABNB.O), opens new tabsaid earlier this month that thebooking window was shortening, signaling consumer uncertainty and caution in travel spending. \"It's all just a bit more pronounced in the case of Expedia with a bigger U.S. presence than peers,\" said BTIG analyst Jake Fuller. The Seattle-based companyreportedrevenue of $2.98 billion for the first quarter, below analysts' expectations of $3.01 billion, according to LSEG compiled data. \"It's clear that U.S. travel has downshifted and to the extent trade/macro uncertainty lingers longer, it is less likely this plays out like the summer 2024 'growth scare',\" Barclays analysts wrote in a note. The U.S. travel industry experienced a \"growth scare\" last summer, as elevated travel costs and uncertainty surrounding the presidential election dampened demand during what is typically a busy season. Expedia reported an adjusted profit of 40 cents per share for the quarter ended March 31, compared with analysts' estimate of 32 cents. At least 10 brokerages cut their price targets on the stock, bringing the median down to $196, according to data compiled by LSEG. Including session moves, Expedia shares have fallen 16.13% so far this year, compared with a 3.9% fall in the S&P 500 index during the same period.",

    "content": "May 9 - Vegas Golden Knights forward Nicolas Roy will have a hearing with the NHL Department of Player Safety on Friday, one day after cross-checking Trent Frederic of the Edmonton Oilers. Roy received a five-minute major and a game misconduct at 5:37 of overtime during the Golden Knights' 5-4 loss to the Oilers on Thursday in Game 2 of the Western Conference semifinal series in Las Vegas. Edmonton holds a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series heading into Game 3 on Saturday in Edmonton. Roy attempted to play the puck while it was airborne but made contact with Frederic's head instead, resulting in a laceration for the Oilers forward. Frederic briefly exited the game before making a quick return to the ice. Edmonton, however, failed to capitalize on the ensuing five-minute power play. Roy, 28, has failed to record a point and owns a minus-4 rating over the first two games of this series. He totaled 31 points (15 goals, 16 assists) in 71 games during the regular season. A Stanley Cup winner with Vegas, Roy has recorded 166 points (68 goals, 98 assists) in 369 career games with the Carolina Hurricanes and Golden Knights. --Field Level Media",

    "title": "Exclusive: US weighs special status for Greenland as quest for island intensifies",
    "content": "WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - U.S. officials are discussing a plan to pull Greenland into America's sphere of influence using a type of agreement that the United States has used to keep close ties with several Pacific Island nations, according to two U.S. officials and another person familiar with the discussions. Under the plan being considered, the Trump administration would propose to Greenland's leaders that the island enter into a so-called Compact of Free Association, or COFA, with the United States. While the precise details of COFA agreements - which have only ever been extended to the small island nations of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands and Palau - vary depending on the signatory, the U.S. government typically provides many essential services, from mail delivery to emergency management to military protection. In exchange, the U.S. military operates freely in COFA countries and trade with the U.S. is largely duty-free. President Donald Trump, who during his first administration floated the idea of acquiring Greenland, has pressed even harder since taking office in January, refusing to rule out taking the island by force. Denmark, which governs the island, has sharply rebuffed the idea. A COFA agreement would stop short of Trump'sambitionto make the island of 57,000 people a part of the U.S. It is not the only Greenland plan on the table, the sources said, and it would face many practical hurdles. Reutersreportedbefore Trump took office that some advisers had informally suggested the idea. But it has not been previously revealed that White House officials have begun talks about the logistics behind such a proposal. Some officials at the National Security Council and the National Energy Dominance Council,which Trump established, are involved in the talks, two of the sources said. The National Economic Council is also involved, one of those sources added. COFA agreements have previously been inked with independent countries, and Greenland would likely need to separate from Denmark for such a plan to proceed. While polls show Greenlanders are interested in independence, surveys also show mostdo not wantto be part of the U.S. A COFA - which cedes significant autonomy to Washington - could be viewed with similar skepticism. One of those involved in the discussions is Markus Thomi, the acting senior director for the National Security Council's Western Hemisphere section, according to two of the sources. David Copley, the key mining official on the NEDC, is also involved in the talks, one of those sources said. The White House did not respond to a request for comment, nor did the Danish Embassy or Greenland's representative office in Washington. The Interior Department, which plays a key role in administering COFA agreements through its Office of Insular Affairs, also did not respond. Washington's existing COFA agreements with Palau, the Marshall Islands and Micronesia are seen across the U.S. political spectrum as important for countering China's growing influence in the Asia Pacific. Still, such accords have hit snags in the past. Republican lawmakers have at timesopposed elementsof the budget allotted to fund COFA agreements, creating deep frustrations in the countries that rely on the funds. Signing a COFA also offers no guarantee that a nation will be immune from influence operations by U.S. rivals. In April, Reuters reported that Chinese nationals had successfullycultivated close tiesto senior political figures in Palau, alarming U.S. officials. Danish leaders have not been approached about the COFA idea and have not had any substantive discussions with the White House about Greenland's future status, one senior European official said. Danish officials have publicly rejected the idea of the U.S. acquiring Greenland, and insist Greenlanders must determine their future. Administration officials argue the island is crucial to the U.S. due to its deposits of minerals that have important high-tech and military applications, but which remain untapped due to labor shortages, scarce infrastructure and various other challenges. An administration official told Reuters the U.S. was helping Greenland diversify its economy and gain greater economic independence from Denmark. The Development Finance Corporation and Export-Import Bank, both U.S. agencies, could play a role in that process, the official said. The official pointed to the Tanbreez Project, which will see rare earths extracted on the island and processed in the U.S., as a particular bright spot in relations with Greenland. New York-based Critical Metals Corp(CRML.O), opens new tabholds a 42% stake in the project, though that stake could increase considerably as part of a complex deal due to be completed later this year. The official said a COFA \"could be an elegant way to address some of the concerns that we have when it comes to Greenland security,\" but did not otherwise comment on the possibility of such an accord.",

    "title": "Video challenge rules proposed to speed up NCAA women's games",
    "content": "May 9 - The NCAA Women's Basketball Rules Committee has forwarded a recommendation that, if approved, would make women's basketball coaches the ones to initiate a challenge by video review under certain conditions. The recommendation, made this week at a meeting in Indianapolis, now will be forwarded to the NCAA Playing Rules Oversight Panel for approval. Potential rule changes are set to be discussed June 10. The rules committee suggested the challenge change take effect for the 2025-26 season. Under the proposal, the plays that would be challenged by a coach include those that were ruled as either out-of-bounds or backcourt violations. Officials are the ones to currently initiate the review, but a change could speed up the game. \"The committee was concerned with pace of play and the number of reviews occurring at the end of games,\" said Nicki Collen, rules committee chair and head women's basketball coach at Baylor. \"This was also an experimental rule in this year's WBIT. By removing the option for officials to review called out-of-bounds violations and allowing coaches to challenge the call, you increase flow at the end of games while still allowing for the opportunity to get the call right.\" Teams would not need to have a timeout available to ask for a video challenge, under the proposal. Should a coach unsuccessfully challenge a play, an administrative technical foul for an excessive timeout would be the result. Other proposed rules changes include eliminating the requirement that jerseys need to be tucked in and setting the shot clock at 20 seconds when the offense gets the ball in its front court following a dead ball. --Field Level Media",

    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has proposed that alliance members meet higher targets for defence spending by 2032, Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said on Friday. Reuters reported last week that Rutte hadproposedNATO members raise defence spending to 3.5% of their GDP, and a further 1.5% on broader security-related items to meet U.S. President Donald Trump's demand for a 5% target. Speaking to reporters after a cabinet meeting, Schoof confirmed those figures, which would represent a major increase from the current NATO goal of spending 2% of GDP on defence. NATO aims to agree the new targets at a summit of alliance leaders including Trump, in The Hague, on June 24-25. \"Rutte has sent a letter to all NATO members to say that he expects that the commitment at the NATO summit will be 3.5% on hard military spending, to be reached in 2032, and 1.5% on related spending such as on infrastructure, cyber security, and similar things also to be reached by 2032,\" Schoof said. NATO did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Schoof's remarks. He said the government of the Netherlands, where Rutte was a long-serving prime minister, would continue discussions to determine its position on the proposal. Other NATO members were also considering Rutte's request and would have to discuss it with their parliaments, he added. Twenty-two of NATO's 32 members meet the current 2% target. But leaders across NATO say that goal is no longer sufficient as they now regard Russia as a far greater threat in the wake of its 2022 full-scaleinvasion of Ukraine. No NATO country meets Trump's 5% target. According to NATO, the United States spends about 3.2% of GDP on defence. Poland spends the biggest share of its GDP - at over 4%.",

    "content": "LAGOS, May 9 (Reuters) - Gunmen shot dead at least 30 travellers in an attack in Nigeria's southeastern Imo state, Amnesty International said on Friday, raising fresh concerns about violence in a region rife with insecurity. More than 20 vehicles and trucks were set ablaze by the attackers, who were suspected to be members of the banned separatist Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Amnesty said in a post on X. Imo police spokesperson Henry Okoye confirmed the attack occurred in Thursday's early hours, but declined comment on the number of fatalities. One of the assailants was killed by the police, Okoye told Reuters on Friday. A police statement said the gunmen, operating in three groups, barricaded the highway at about 0400 GMT and shot sporadically before setting vehicles ablaze. \"A full-scale search and cordon operation is currently underway, with security operatives combing nearby forests and surrounding areas where the suspects are believed to be hiding,\" the police said in the statement. IPOB campaigns for the secession of southeastern Nigeria, where the majority belong to the Igbo ethnic group. Nigerian authorities have labelled IPOB a terrorist organisation. Civil war engulfed the Biafra region in the late 1960s, killing more than 1 million people. Thursday's attack coincided with a visit by President Bola Tinubu to the region, occurring in the same week that IPOB leader Nnamdi Kanu appeared in federal court where he is facing trial onterrorism charges. Amnesty called on Nigerian authorities to investigate the attack and bring the perpetrators to justice.",

    "title": "New FEMA head says he will 'run right over' staff who resist his changes",
    "content": "WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - David Richardson, the new head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, told staff on Friday he will \"run right over\" anyone who resists changes and that all decisions must now go through him. \"I, and I alone in FEMA, speak for FEMA. I'm here to carry out the president's intent for FEMA,\" Richardson, who was most recently assistant secretary for DHS' office for countering weapons of mass destruction, told the staff. Richardson spoke one day after he was appointed toreplaceacting FEMA chief Cameron Hamilton, who was ousted by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem after telling a congressional hearing he did not support eliminating the agency. PresidentDonald Trumpand Noem have called for the agency to be shrunk or even abolished, arguing that many of its functions can be carried out by the states, a stance that is already leading to decreased federal aid for disasters. Richardson, a former Marine artillery officer and combat veteran, told staff in an all-hands call that was heavy on references to his military experience that all decisions, including those on spending, would go through him. Standing behind a lectern and speaking in a forceful tone, Richardson said in his experience from carrying out reforms that roughly 20% of an organization will resist. \"Obfuscation, delay, undermining. If you're one of those 20% of people and you think those tactics and techniques are going to help you, they will not, because I will run right over you,\" Richardson said. \"Don't get in my way... I know all the tricks.\" The leadership change comes at a time when the agency is helping states and local communities prepare for the onset of hurricane season on June 1. FEMA coordinates the federal response to disasters and works with state and local officials on disaster preparedness and recovery with training, education and planning. Under Hamilton, FEMA had already moved to slash costs and narrow the agency's mission. In April, Hamilton sent the White House a memo with suggestions for reducing FEMA's role in responding to disasters. It included an option for raising the threshold for providing aid to disaster-hit states. In his first 100 days, Trump turned down a series of requests for major disaster aid that the affected states, both Republican- and Democratic-run, have said would have been approved under past administrations. Richardson said he would look to narrow the agency's operations to only actions that \"are within the law\" and \"within our mission.\" Without giving any details, he said the agency was doing things outside of its mandate, which he suggested explained \"some of the outcry about FEMA right now.\" He directed staff in two memos sent on Friday to begin collating lists of FEMA tasks and authorities in the interest of identifying redundancies and achieving Trump's vision for the agency, according to copies of the memos seen by Reuters. \"We're going to find out how to do things better. We're going to find out how to push things down to the states that should be done at state level. Also we're going to find out how we can do more cost sharing with the states,\" he said. Richardson has served at DHS' Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office since January. In a town hall on Friday, Richardson told CWMD staff that he plans to split his time between CWMD and FEMA, according to a source familiar with the situation. FEMA did not respond to a request for details about how Richardson will divide his time. Richardson addressed a FEMA workforce that has been dwindling in size, targeted for cuts like other agencies by Trump andElon Musk'sDepartment of Government Efficiency. Some 2,000 FEMA employees have acceptedincentives to leave or were terminatedsince the start of the Trump administration, shrinking its full-time staff by about one third, according to Michael Coen, former FEMA chief of staff under the administrations of Democratic Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. Coen predicted Richardson's address would further demoralize the staff. \"I think it's going to lead to more departures from the agency, which is just going to further decrease FEMA's capability for whenever the next catastrophic event happens.\"",

U.S. President Donald Trump called on Thursday for a30-day unconditional ceasefirebetween Russia and Ukraine, warning that Washington and its partners would impose further sanctions if the ceasefire was not respected. Ukraine hasexpressed readiness to acceptthe U.S. proposal. Russia has unilaterally declared a three-day ceasefire running from May 8-10 to coincide with the80th anniversaryof the end of World War Two. \"We're not completely with a finalised project, but we hope that we're at a moment of convergence,\" said the diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity. \"What could happen in the coming hours and days, there could be an announcement of a ceasefire either of 30 days or compartmentalized, which is still being discussed.\" France, Britain and Germanyin recent weeks have sought closer coordination with Washington. Two weeks ago they pushed back against some U.S. proposals on how to end Russia's war in Ukraine, making counterproposals on issues from territory to sanctions, according to the full texts of the proposals seen by Reuters. \"We are reaching a point where we will not wait for a formal response from Moscow to a joint proposal to declare this ceasefire,\" said the source. The source said there were still discussions on whether to announce a unilateral ceasefire or to give a short response time to Russia, although if it refused then new American and EU sanctions would be imposed on Moscow. The two sides are coordinating on the sanctions packages. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, who was in Washington last week to meet U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, was in Ukraine on Friday. A meeting of Ukraine's closest allies is due to take place on Saturday where the U.S.-European proposal will be discussed. President Emmanuel Macronsaid earlier on Friday France would take part in the hybrid meeting. The source said political and technical talks between Europe and the U.S. had stepped up since last week. Trump and Macron spoke on Thursday to discuss the ceasefire proposal. \"We felt in the discussions with the Americans a certain irritation towards the Russian posture, the lack of reactivity and seriousness in its responses to what was proposed before,\" the source said. \"The decision is practically taken.\"",

    "content": "KYIV/BUDAPEST, May 9 (Reuters) - Ukraine and Hungary said on Friday they were expelling two diplomats each after each side accused the other of engaging in espionage. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha, writing on the X social media platform, announced the action after Kyiv's SBU security agency said it had uncovered a spy network run by the Hungarian state to obtain intelligence about its defence. Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said Budapest's expulsion order was in response to what he called Ukrainian \"propaganda\". \"Two Hungarian diplomats must leave our country within 48 hours. We have just summoned Hungarian Ambassador to MFA_Ukraine and presented him with the relevant note,\" Sybiha wrote on X in English. \"We are acting in response to Hungary’s actions, based on the principle of reciprocity and our national interests.\" Ukraine's SBU said in a statement it had detained two suspected agents who, it said, were being run by Hungarian military intelligence. It was the first time in Ukraine's history that a Hungarian spy network had been found to be working against Kyiv's interests, it said. Hungary is part of the European Union and NATO, two blocs with which Kyiv is closely allied in Russia'swar in Ukraine, but relations between Kyiv and Budapest have often been fraught. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has been sceptical about Western military aid for Ukraine. He has also maintained relations withVladimir Putin, putting him at odds with most other EU leaders, who have sought to isolate the Russian president since Moscow's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The SBU said the two suspects were former members of Ukraine's military, were in custody and had been given notice they were under suspicion of committing state treason. It said they were recruited by a handler in Hungarian military intelligence, and given cash and special equipment for secret communication. The SBU said the alleged agents were tasked with passing on to their handler details about Ukraine's air defence batteries, and other military capabilities in the Transcarpathia region of southwestern Ukraine. Ukraine is home to around 150,000 ethnic Hungarians, most of them in the Transcarpathia region. Orban's government and Kyiv have clashed over the community's language rights. Szijjarto told a press conference he regarded the move as Ukrainian propaganda that should be treated with caution before announcing that Budapest had expelled from Hungary two people it had identified as spies. \"We do not tolerate that Ukraine should continuously launch such defamatory acts against Hungary and the Hungarian people,\" Szijjarto said in a Facebook video. \"Therefore, today we have expelled from Hungary two spies working under diplomatic cover at Ukraine's embassy in Budapest.\" Szijjarto accused Ukraine of often using anti-Hungarian propaganda that proved unfounded and said Ukraine's latest move was driven by Hungary's opposition to providing military aid to Ukraine as it fends off Russia's three-year-old invasion.",

    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the first at-home test for cervical cancer screening, its maker Teal Health said on Friday, offering an alternative to Pap smears that need to be undertaken at a doctor's office. Pap smear tests have significantly reduced cancer incidence from when they were first introduced 80 years ago. But they can be uncomfortable due to the requirement for an in-clinic exam. Teal Health said the FDA's decision was based on a study in more than 600 women that showed self-collected samples using its test had the same performance as clinician-collected samples. The approval is \"not just about an innovative new product, it's about finally giving women an option that makes sense for their lives — something that can be done quickly and comfortably at home,\" said Teal's co-founder and CEO Kara Egan. Each year in the U.S., about 11,500 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed and about 4,000 women die of this, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The startup's test, Teal Wand, detects human papillomavirus (HPV), which is responsible for nearly all cervical cancers, similar to Roche's(ROG.S), opens new tabcobas HPV test. But Teal Wand allows women to collect samples from home and send it to a certified lab for testing, while Roche's test is approved for use in the clinic. Teal Health did not disclose the test's price, but said it was working with major insurance providers for coverage and flexible payment options. Egan pointed to another at-home test called Cologuard, made by Exact Sciences(EXAS.O), opens new tab, to detect colon cancer. \"So Cologuard (is) fully covered by most insurance, but also, if you have to pay out pocket, it's around $600.

    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - Charlotte Yven on Friday became the first woman to win the Transat Paprec twice, crossing the Caribbean finish line with co-skipper Hugo Dhallenne after a nail-biting finale that saw the top 13 boats finish within three hours of each other. The Skipper Macif duo navigated through a Caribbean calm that compressed the fleet in the final days, erasing comfortable leads and giving the 3,890-nautical-mile race from Concarneau, France, one of the tightest finishes in its history. \"We adapted, supported each other, and fought to the end,\" said Yven, who joins sailing great Armel Le Cleac’h as the only two-time winners. \"The margins were tiny, but we just focused on our own wind and staying fast - that made the difference.\" The Transat Paprec is a prestigious biennial transatlantic sailing race that challenges mixed-gender, double-handed crews to navigate from Concarneau to Saint-Barthelemy. Established in 1992, the race was rebranded in 2023 when it introduced a groundbreaking requirement for each team to consist of one man and one woman. Competitors sail identically matched Figaro Beneteau 3 yachts over a demanding 3,800-nautical-mile course, making it a true test of skill, strategy, and endurance. Romain Bouillard and Irina Gracheva (Decrochons la Lune) claimed second place 43 minutes later despite a torn spinnaker, while local favourite Cindy Brin became the first Saint-Barthelemy native to finish the race, taking third place with co-skipper Thomas Andre aboard Cap St Barth to thunderous local support. \"I already felt like I’d won by just taking the start,\" said Brin, welcomed by some 200 boats in Gustavia harbour. \"But I never expected third place. I doubted myself every day - but Thomas always brought the confidence back. Twenty-four years ago, I was on my father's boat saying, 'One day, Dad, that will be me.' Today, it is!\" The race's knife-edge competition was underscored by the mere 35 seconds separating Brin from fourth-place finishers Mael Garnier and Catherine Hunt (Selencia-Cerfrance) after 18 days at sea, in a bunched finish race director Francis Le Goff described as unprecedented.",

    "title": "Walmart turns to India to avoid high tariffs, but garment workers scarce",
    "content": "TIRUPPUR, India/DHAKA, Bangladesh, May 9 (Reuters) - In a garment hub in south India, R.K. Sivasubramaniam is fielding requests from Walmart and Costco who want to sidestep higher U.S. tariffs faced by rival Asian suppliers, Bangladesh and China. But rows of idle sewing lines at his factory lay bare his biggest challenge. \"Even if orders come, we need labour. We don't have sufficient labour,\" said the managing director of Raft Garments which supplies underwear and t-shirts priced as low as $1 to U.S. brands. Considered India's knitwear capital, Tiruppur city in the southern state of Tamil Nadu accounts for nearly one-third of the country's $16 billion in apparel exports, and is staring at a huge opportunity as U.S. buyers explore ramping up sourcing from India in the face of heftier tariffs on other Asian hubs. U.S. President Donald Trump plans to hit India, the world's sixth largest textile and apparel exporter, with a 26% tariff from July, below the 37% imposed on Bangladesh, 46% on Vietnam and 145% on China - all of which are bigger American suppliers. Those tariffs will make apparel from India much more competitive with both Bangladesh and China. But the mood is somber at the Tiruppur textile park as it faces a reality check: India's hopes of capitalising on its tariff advantage are hindered by a skilled labour crunch, limited economies of scale, and high costs. Raft Garments wants to expand production to tackle new orders but is importing high-end machines to automate some stitching processes, given the business for now heavily depends on migrant labour, which is very tough to find or retain. Garment exporters in India say workers have to be trained and many leave within months to work at smaller, unorganised units that allow longer hours and pay more. The larger manufacturers can't match them due to foreign clients' requirements on cost and workers' conditions, according to Reuters interviews with 10 manufacturers and apparel exporter trade groups representing 9,000 businesses. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has for years courted foreign investors to his \"Make in India\" programme to turn the South Asian nation into a global manufacturing hub. A shortage of skilled workers in a nation where 90% of the labour force operates in the informal sector is seen as a big roadblock, especially in labour-intensive sectors like garments. Tiruppur offers a glimpse of India's labour strain. \"We need at least 100,000 workers,\" said Kumar Duraiswamy of the exporters association in Tiruppur, where he said more than 1 million people currently work. Modi's government last year said it was extending a programme to specifically train 300,000 people in textile-related skills, including garment making. In the textile hub, some have taken matters into their own hands. Amid a hum of sewing machines at the Cotton Blossom factory, which makes 1.2 million garments a month, including for American sporting goods retailer Bass Pro Shops, Naveen Micheal John said he has set up three centres thousands of miles away to train and source migrant workers. And even then, most return to their home towns after a few months. \"We skill them there for three months, then they are here for seven months. Then they return back,\" John said during a tour of his garment unit, adding he wants to look at other states where labour and government incentives both may be better. China's $16.5 billion worth of apparel exports, Vietnam's $14.9 billion and Bangladesh's $7.3 billion made them the three biggest suppliers to America in 2024, when India shipped goods worth $4.7 billion, according to U.S. government data. U.S. companies have for years been diversifying their supply chains beyond China amid geopolitical tensions. And even before the news of tariffs in April, now paused until July, Bangladesh's garment industry began losing its sheen amid political turmoil there. A survey of 30 leading U.S. apparel brands by the United States Fashion Industry Association showed India had emerged as the most popular sourcing hub in 2024, with nearly 60% of respondents planning to expand sourcing from there. With the tariffs, India's exports would cost $4.31 per square metre of apparel, compared with $4.24 for Bangladesh and $4.35 for China, a sharp improvement on India's competitiveness without the levies, according to Reuters calculations based on 2024 import data from the U.S. Office of Textiles and Apparel. But it's in the economies of scale where India loses. Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association says an average garment factory there has at least 1,200 workers, whereas in India, according to its Apparel Export Promotion Council, there are only 600 to 800. \"Bangladesh capacities are huge ... We have issues of capacity constraint, lack of economy of scale due to smaller size of factories, labour unavailability during peak seasons,\" said Mithileshwar Thakur of the Indian trade group. To address those challenges, garment makers have started to set up factories in states where migrant workers come from, he said. In Tiruppur, its exports association says the largest 100 exporters contributed 50% of its $5 billion sales last fiscal year, with the rest from 2,400 units, a telling sign of the fragmented and largely smaller-scale operations. Raft makes 12 million garment pieces a year with a workforce of just 250 people. A U.S. client is close to placing an order for 3 million units, which will stretch the factory to its limit and force it to consider expansion. \"This one order is more than enough for us,\" said Sivasubramaniam. Data from shipping consultants Ocean Audit showed Walmart(WMT.N), opens new tabimported 1,100 containers of household goods and clothing between April 2 and May 4 from India, nearly double the same period last year, including cotton shirts and pleated maxi skirts. In a statement, Walmart said it sources from more than 70 countries around the world as it aims to find the right mix of suppliers and products. While U.S. retailers are lodging more queries in Tiruppur, pricing negotiations remain contentious due to higher labour and other costs. Indian brokerage Avendus Spark said in March Bangladesh's cost of labour stood at $139 per month, compared to India's $180 and China's $514. P. Senthilkumar, a senior partner at India's Vector Consulting Group, said India had stricter rules for overtime policies and worker shifts, further raising costs. In Dhaka, Anwar-ul-Alam Chowdhury of Evince Group said most of their U.S. buyers were sticking with Bangladesh, given the \"large production capacity, lower costs, and reliable quality give us a clear edge.\" In India, though, Tiruppur exporters said they are in hectic talks with many U.S. clients who love the Bangladesh cost advantage and are aggressively bargaining. At Walmart-supplier Balu Exports, Mahesh Kumar Jegadeesan said U.S. clients had conveyed \"we will not budge on the price\" and were willing to move some orders only if Indian exporters can match prices. Inside the nearby Raft Garments factory, where women were stitching underwear, the smile on managing director Sivasubramaniam's face sparked by 14 new business inquiries of recent weeks faded quickly. \"All want us to match Bangladesh prices. Price is a big problem,\" he said.",

    "title": "Israel won't be involved in new Gaza aid plan, only in security, US envoy says",
    "content": "JERUSALEM, May 9 (Reuters) - A U.S.-backed mechanism for getting aid into Gaza should take effect soon, Washington's envoy to Israel said on Friday ahead of PresidentDonald Trump's visit to the Middle East, without detailing how this would work with no ceasefire in place. Gaza's residents face possible famine, the U.N. says, with Israel enforcing a months-long blockade on aid to the small Palestinian enclave and vowing to expand its military campaign against Hamas militants after breaking a truce in March. U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee said several partners had already committed to taking part in the aid arrangement, which would be handled by private companies, but declined to name them, saying details would be released in the coming days. \"There has been a good initial response,\" the former Republican governor told reporters at the embassy in Jerusalem. \"There are nonprofit organisations that will be a part of the leadership,\" he said, adding that other organisations and governments would also need to be involved, though not Israel. Tikva Forum, a hawkish Israeli group representing some relatives of hostages held in Gaza, criticised the announcement, saying aid deliveries should be conditional on Hamas releasing the 59 captives in Gaza. Hamas senior official Basem Naim said the plan was close to \"the Israeli vision of militarising aid\" and said it would fail, at the same time warning local parties against \"becoming tools in the Zionist occupation's schemes\". Trump, who seeks a landmark deal that would see Israel and Saudi Arabia establish diplomatic relations, will visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates next week. Trump had teased a major announcement ahead of the trip. It was unclear if that was what Huckabee announced on Friday. Anticipation has been building about a new aid plan for Gaza, laid waste by 19 months of an Israeli air and ground war against Hamas that has destroyed much of the infrastructure and displaced most of its 2.3 million population several times. \"It will not be perfect, especially in the early days,\" Huckabee said. \"It is a logistical challenge to make this work.\" European leaders and aid groups have criticised a plan by Israel, which has prevented aid from entering Gaza since ditching a two-month-old truce in March, for private companies to take over humanitarian distributions in the enclave. Israel has accused agencies including the United Nations of allowing aid to fall into the hands of Hamas, which it has said is seizing supplies intended for civilians and given them to its own forces or selling them to raise funds. Hamas denies this. \"The Israelis are going to be involved in providing necessary military security because it is a war zone, but they will not be involved in the distribution of the food or even bringing the food into Gaza,\" Huckabee told a press conference. Asked whether the supply of aid hinged on a ceasefire being restored, Huckabee said: \"The humanitarian aid will not depend on anything other than our ability to get the food into Gaza.\" The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) on Friday criticised emerging plans to take over distribution of aid in Gaza floated by both Israel and the United States, saying this would increase suffering for children and families. A proposal is circulating among the aid community for a Gaza Humanitarian Foundation that would distribute food from four \"Secure Distribution Sites\", resembling plans announced by Israel earlier this week, but drew criticism that it would effectively worsen displacement among the Gaza population. Huckabee said there would be an \"initial number\" of distribution centres that could feed \"perhaps over a million people\" before being scaled up to ultimately reach two million. \"Private security\" would be responsible for the safety of workers getting into the distribution centres and in the distribution of the food itself, Huckabee said, declining to comment on rules of engagement for security personnel. \"Everything would be done in accordance with international law,\" he said. Mediation efforts by the United States, Qatar, and Egypt have not been successful in implementing a second phase of the ceasefire. Israel demands the total disarmament of Hamas, which the Islamist group rejects. Hamas has said it is willing to free all remaining hostages seized by its gunmen in attacks on communities in southern Israel on October 7, 2023, and agree to a permanent ceasefire if Israel pulls out completely from Gaza. Hamas' attacks on October 7, 2023 killed 1,200 people and 251 were taken hostage back to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's campaign has killed more than 52,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, according to Hamas-run health authorities.",

    "title": "HR tech firm Rippling raises new funding at $16.8 billion valuation, no IPO plans",
    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - HR software startup Rippling said on Friday it raised $450 million in a Series G funding round, valuing the company at $16.8 billion, as it expands its workforce management products and focuses on growing revenue globally over profitability. Y Combinator, Elad Gil, Sands Capital, GIC and Goldman Sachs Growth, along with other existing investors, participated in the round. In addition to the primary financing, the San Francisco-based startup also plans to repurchase up to $200 million of equity from current and former employees through a tender offer. Rippling's CEO Praker Conrad said the tender offer is likely to be an annual event, joining a growing list of high-profile private companies that don't want to go public yet but still want to offer ways for employees and early investors to cash out. \"I think the company would really need to be profitable before we go public,\" Conrad said in an interview. \"We don't have any specific plans to go public. But I think we're at a scale where we want to try to create liquidity opportunities for employees and for investors.\" This round, which values the company higher than its previous valuation of $13.5 billion in early 2024, faced an unexpected challenge due to its timing, as it was launched weeks before President Trump's tariff announcement, which has caused major volatility in the stock market. It also came amid ongoing legal disputes with competitor Deel, in which Deel was accused of corporate espionage. Rippling, while not profitable, said it has well surpassed $100 million in annual recurring revenue and now serves over 20,000 customers with its expanding suite of more than 20 products spanning HR, IT and finance management, and plans to use the proceeds to invest in the core products. \"We're fortunate that we're still growing at a pretty fast pace. For us, the trade-off is always like, well, we could be profitable if we grew more slowly. And right now, the decision is that we want to keep growing,\" said Conrad. Founded in 2016, Rippling's platform integrates workforce management services including payroll, benefits and corporate card services. International expansion has been a key driver of growth for the company amid increasing demand for HR solutions that can manage distributed workforces across multiple countries. Rippling recently filed alawsuitagainst Deel, alleging corporate espionage and other improper business practices. A former Rippling employee confessed to spying for Deel Inc, according to an affidavit made public in an Irish court in April. The litigation has drawn attention to competitive practices and raised questions about ethical standards in the tech industry.",

    "title": "Migrants told of Libya deportation waited hours on tarmac, attorney says",
    "content": "WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - Migrants in Texas who were told they would be deported to Libya sat on a military airfield tarmac for hours on Wednesday, unsure of what would happen next, an attorney for one of the men told Reuters. The attorney, Tin Thanh Nguyen, said his client, a Vietnamese construction worker from Los Angeles, was among the migrants woken in the early morning hours and bused from an immigration detention center in Pearsall, Texas, to an airfield where a military aircraft awaited them. After several hours, they were bused back to the detention center around noon, the attorney said on Thursday. The Department of Homeland Security, the Pentagon and the State Department did not respond to requests for comment. Reuters wasfirst to reportthat U.S. President Donald Trump's administration was poised to deport migrants to Libya, a move that would escalate his immigration crackdown which has already drawn legal backlash. Officials earlier this week told Reuters the U.S. military could fly the migrants to the North African country as soon as Wednesday, but stressed that plans could change. A U.S. official told Reuters the flight never departed. As of Friday, it was unclear if the administration was still planning to proceed with the deportations. A federal judge in Boston ruled on Wednesday that any effort by the Trump administration to deport non-Libyan migrants to Libya without adequate screenings for possible persecution or torture would clearly violate a prior court order. Lawyers for a group of migrants pursuing a class action lawsuit had made an emergency request to the court hours after the news broke of the potential flight to Libya. Nguyen, who declined to name his client, said the man was told on Monday to sign a document agreeing to be deported to Libya. The man, who does not read English well, declined to sign it and was placed in solitary confinement and shackled along with four or five other men, the attorney said. The man was never provided an opportunity to express a fear of being deported to Libya as required under federal immigration law and the recent judicial order, Nguyen said. \"They said, 'We're deporting you to Libya,' even though he hadn't signed the form, he didn't know what the form was,\" Nguyen said. Nguyen said his client, originally from Vietnam, has lived in the U.S. since the 1990s but was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement earlier this year during a regular check-in. Vietnam declines to accept some deportees and processes deportation paperwork slowly, Nguyen said, making it harder for the U.S. to send deportees there.",

    "content": "NANCY, France, May 9 (Reuters) - France and Poland signed a treaty on Friday to increase cooperation on defence, nuclear energy and other measures, in a sign of growing alliances between European nations amid concerns about U.S. commitment to Europe's security. The signing came a day before Ukraine hosts leaders of the so-called \"coalition of the willing\" - countries led by France and Britain that want to step up support for Ukraine in the face of a more sceptical Trump administration. President Emmanuel Macron, speaking alongside Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, said France would participate in the Ukraine summit but declined to say whether he would attend, saying he would travel to Ukraine when necessary. The treaty with Poland includes a mutual assistance clause, deepening a commitment between the two NATO member states to support each other in case of an attack, and a pledge to deepen military and technological links. \"I am deeply convinced that from today France and Poland in these difficult times will be able to count on each other in every situation,\" Tusk said. Earlier, Tusk said the pact would pave the way for cooperation on a potential extension of the French nuclear umbrella to cover Poland. However, there was no specific mention of access to France's nuclear deterrent in the treaty itself. Macron said in March he was open to extendingFrench nuclear capabilities to other Europeannations, partly in response to growing doubts over U.S.President Donald Trump'slong-term commitment to European security. The new pact does, however, include provisions for deeper integration on nuclear energy, with France eager to export its nuclear know-how across Europe and beyond. The treaty is testament to fast-growing Poland's increasingly pivotal role on the European stage, thanks to its strategic position on the continent's eastern flank. Poland spends 4.12% of its economic output on defence,the highest percentagein the NATO alliance. Tusk's centrist, pro-European government is keen to diversify its security partnerships beyond Washington. The treaty is the first that France has signed with a central European country after a series of pacts with Italy, Spain and Germany. It was signed in the eastern French city of Nancy, where Poland's King Stanislaw Leszczynski lived in the late 18th century, becoming Duke of Lorraine after losing the Polish throne.",

    "content": "TOKYO, May 9 (Reuters) - Panasonic Holdings(6752.T), opens new tabsaid on Friday it will cut 10,000 staff and expects to book restructuring costs of 130 billion yen ($896.06 million) this business year as part of an overhaul of the company. The electronics manufacturer will make the staff cuts mainly in the current business year, with half of them planned for Japan and the other half for overseas, it said in a statement. The cuts will come through consolidation of sales and indirect operations as well as sites, business terminations and employees in Japan taking early retirement, it said. Panasonic has around 228,000 staff worldwide, according to its website. The company's restructuring aims to improve group profitability and seeks to achieve a return on equity - a measure of profitability - of 10% by the fiscal year ending in March 2029. Panasonic also said it will target a group adjusted operating profit of at least 600 billion yen in the fiscal year to March 31, 2027, partly due to a revamp of its consumer electronics business, termination of loss-making businesses and streamlining of IT investments. The company said it will review the operational efficiency of its group companies, particularly in sales and back-office divisions, in an update of its overhaul announced inFebruary. Almost half of the restructuring costs will be booked in its Lifestyle business, which includes home electronics and heating and ventilation systems, and another 40% in \"other\" businesses, including its holding company. It did not expect to book any restructuring costs in its energy business. Panasonic also forecast a 39% increase in operating profit at its electric vehicle battery-making energy business this fiscal year to March 31, 2026, upgrading it to 167 billion yen on expected higher battery and energy storage system sales.

    "title": "Still hungry: Dalin back at the helm to defend IMOCA crown",
    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - Charlie Dalin,fresh from rewriting the Vendee Globe record books, has set his sights on defending his IMOCA Globe Series title with the methodical precision that has become his trademark in offshore racing. The 40-year-old French skipper, who sliced nine days off the previous round-the-world record, approaches the 2025 season with characteristic understatement aboard MACIF Sante Prevoyance. \"My objective this year? Well, it's to win races again,\" Dalin told IMOCA officials this week. \"I'm still passionate as before and, you know, I love sailing IMOCAs.\" IMOCAs are 60-foot high-performance monohulls built for solo or short-handed offshore racing, known for balancing cutting-edge design - like hydrofoils and carbon fibre hulls - with the raw demands of long-distance endurance. Dalin will begin his 2025 campaign with June's Course des Caps, a 2,000-mile tactical challenge around Britain's demanding coastline, but has a special focus on October's Transat Cafe L'Or from Le Havre to Martinique, a race carrying personal significance. \"It's an important race for me because I am from Le Havre and I couldn't race last time,\" said Dalin, who claimed victory there in 2019. \"I have revenge to take on that event. I would quite like to win it a second time.\" The competitive landscape remains formidable. Dalin anticipates challenges from last year's runner-up Yoann Richomme on Paprec Arkea, Thomas Ruyant paired with Ambrogio Beccaria, and veteran Jeremie Beyou aboard Charal. Adding intrigue is newcomer Elodie Bonafous commanding Horizon 29, a sistership to Dalin's vessel. \"It will be interesting to sail against a sistership of MACIF Sante Prevoyance and see how she performs,\" he noted. While acknowledging the physical toll of his Vendee Globe campaign, Dalin expressed confidence in his recovery timeline, targeting full readiness by the season's start. Now firmly established as the sailor everyone aims to beat, Dalin embraces his position with philosophical ease. \"I'd rather be in this situation than the reverse,\" he smiled. The IMOCA Globe Series is a tiered circuit of offshore yacht races, ranging from short coastal duels to gruelling round-the-world marathons. At the top are Grade 1 epics like the Vendee Globe and The Ocean Race, while Grade 2 includes transatlantic tests such as the Route du Rhum and Transat Jacques Vabre. Shorter Grade 3 and 4 events - like the Course des Caps, Defi Azimut and Rolex Fastnet - demand precision, stamina and tactical sharpness. Together, they form a global proving ground for the world's best offshore sailors. Dalin claimed the 2024 title with 800 points in a dominant French showing. Fellow countrymen Richomme and Sebastien Simon (Groupe Dubreuil) took second and third with 730 and 595 points respectively. Germany's Boris Herrmann broke the French hold, steering Malizia – Sea Explorer to fourth on 571 points. The 2025 series kicks off with the 2,000 nautical-mile Course des Caps on June 29, and with his Vendee victory still fresh and the sails of MACIF Sante Prevoyance trimmed for another season, Dalin is plotting another year at the front of the fleet.",

    "title": "FedEx board member tapped to lead U.S. Postal Service",
    "content": "WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Postal Service Board on Friday said it named David Steiner, a FedEx board member and former CEO of Waste Management, as the new postmaster general after the White House pressured the prior leader to resign in March. Postal unions have raised sharp concerns about Steiner's selection to succeed Postmaster General Louis DeJoy because he sits on the board of a competitor to the Postal Service. The Postal Service reported a wider net loss of $3.3 billion for the three months ending March 31 as itcontinues to hike stamp pricesand seek ways to cut costs. \"I believe strongly in maintaining its role as an independent establishment of the executive branch,\" Steiner said in a statement released Friday. The board said it expects him to start in July, and that he will leave the Board at FedEx. USPS said on Friday its controllable loss was $848 million, up from $317 million in the same quarter last year as mail volume continued to fall. In February, President Donald Trump called the agency a \"tremendous loser for this country\" and has said is considering merging the Postal Service withthe U.S. Commerce Department. Democratic lawmakers have said such a move would violate federal law. The White House did not immediately comment Friday. American Postal Workers Union President Mark Dimondstein told Reuters this week that Steiner was the wrong choice. \"You don't put the fox in charge of guarding the hen house,\" Dimondstein said, adding it was \"an abdication of their duty to remain independent of this administration.\" FedEx Executive Chairman Fred Smith praised Steiner's selection. \"David’s sharp business acumen will be key to addressing the significant challenges facing the United States Postal Service,\" Smith said, noting USPS has lost more than $108 billion since 2007. \"The USPS must be reformed to improve service, to no longer rely on taxpayers to subsidize its operations, and to be held accountable to the same rules as private sector companies.\" Democratic lawmakers for years called for DeJoy to be fired but agreed to give USPS $50 billion in financial relief in 2022. DeJoy led an effort to dramatically restructure USPS over the last five years, including cutting forecast cumulative losses over a decade to $80 billion from $160 billion even as mail volumes fell to the lowest level since 1968.",

New Jersey Cardinal Joseph Tobin, one of the other 132 clerics locked inside the Sistine Chapel with Prevost for the conclave, said he looked at the future pope during one of the last ballots. \"I took a look at Bob, because his name had been floating around and he had his head in his hands,\" Tobin said, using Prevost's nickname. \"I was praying for him, because I couldn't imagine what happens to a human being when you're facing something like that.\" \"And then when he accepted, it was like he was made for it,\" said Tobin. \"Whatever anguish was resolved.

Leo, alargely unknown figureon the world stage, is a former U.S. missionary in Peru who was a senior Vatican official for the past two years. The cardinals offered small insights into the secretive conclave process and even joked about the food. New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan called it a \"good, good, good, good impetus to get this over with.\" They also speculated about how Leo, the first U.S. pope, might engage with President Donald Trump. Dolan said he did not think Prevost's nationality \"had much weight\" in the cardinals' decision. \"It should not startle us that we should look to Pope Leo as a bridge builder,\" said Dolan. \"Will he want to build bridges with Donald Trump? I suppose. But he will want to build bridges with the leader of every nation.\" The late Pope Francis was asharp critic of Trump, saying earlier this year that the president's plan to deport millions of migrants in the U.S. was a \"disgrace\".

    "content": "NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - Lawyers for Sean \"Diddy\" Combs on Friday said they plan to accuse the hip-hop mogul's ex-girlfriend of domestic violence when she takes the stand in his sex trafficking trial. Combs has pleadednot guiltyto one count of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation for prostitution - all felonies. He could face decades or even life in prison if convicted at the trial in Manhattan federal court. Defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo told U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian during a hearing Friday that he plans to show there was mutual violence between Combs and his ex-girlfriend Casandra \"Cassie\" Ventura, who is expected to testify as a star witness for the prosecution. \"I think we’re probably going to refer to that as domestic violence,\" Agnifilo said, arguing Ventura's alleged history of violence would undercut prosecutors' argument that she was a victim. Ventura's lawyers declined to comment on Agnifilo's remarks. Subramanian appeared disinclined to allow the defense to introduce evidence of any alleged violence by Ventura but said he would rule on the issue on Monday, when a jury of 12 New Yorkers is set to be finalized ahead of opening statements by defense lawyers and prosecutors. Combs, 55, was present in the courtroom Friday sported graying hair and a sweater over a white shirt. He has been held in a federal lockup in Brooklyn since his arrest last September.

    "title": "US-UK deal 'good news' but tariffs still higher, Bank of England governor says",
    "content": "LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said the trade deal concluded between the United States and Britain was a good thing but still left tariffs on most British goods exports to the U.S. higher than they were before last month. Before details of the deal were announced on Thursday, the BoE published estimates showing U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff plans as of April 29 would shrink Britain's economy by about 0.3% over three years. Around two thirds of the hit was due to the direct impact of tariffs in reducing demand for British exports in the United States and elsewhere, while the remainder reflected the impact of trade policy uncertainty in lowering global growth. Under thedeal agreed on Thursday, the United States will continue to impose a new 10% tariff on imports of most British goods but will reduce higher tariffs on imports of British cars, steel and aluminium. \"It's good news. I have to say, it's 'good news' in a world where it will leave the effective tariff rate higher than it was before all of this started. I do think we need to bear that in mind,\" Bailey said in a question and answer session at an economics conference in Reykjavik. Bailey has spoken repeatedly of his wish to preserve an open global trading system while tackling the persistent large trade surpluses run by some countries. Earlier on Friday the BBC published an interview with Bailey where he said Britain should do \"everything we can\" to reverse the fall in goods exports to the European Union which followed Britain's 2020 departure from the bloc. While goods exports do not form as big a share of Britain's economy as for some other countries, Britain was more exposed than many to the health of the global economy, Bailey said. \"The impact of all these developments on the trade front on the UK outlook, is conditional therefore not only on the UK trade agreement, but also what the rest of the world agrees as well,\" he added in Reykjavik. (This story has been corrected to fix the description of tariff impact in paragraph 3)",

    "title": "With Xi at his side, Putin marks WW2 victory as Ukraine war grinds on",
    "content": "MOSCOW, May 9 (Reuters) - Russia marked the 80th anniversary of the Soviet Union's victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two on Friday with a major military parade that went off without any reports of Ukrainian attacks despite three years of devastating war. PresidentVladimir Putin, the longest-serving Kremlin chief since Josef Stalin, stood beside China's Xi Jinping, several dozen other leaders and Russian veterans on a roofed tribune beside Lenin's mausoleum as Russian troops marched past. Putin said Russia would never accept attempts to belittle the Soviet Union's decisive role in defeating Nazi Germany, but that Moscow also recognised the part played by the Western allies in defeating Adolf Hitler. \"The Soviet Union took upon itself the most ferocious, merciless blows of the enemy,\" Putin said. \"We highly appreciate the contribution of the soldiers of the Allied armies, the members of the resistance, the courageous people of China, and all those who fought for a peaceful future to our common struggle.\" Putin made no criticism of the West and referred only in passing to the Ukrainewar, Europe's deadliest since World War Two, but it haunted the celebration. More than 11,500 troops were lined up in ranks on Red Square, including 1,500 who have fought in Ukraine. Drones- the biggest technological innovation of the war - were paraded for the first time, as well as tanks and intercontinental Yars missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads. Ukraine attacked Moscow with drones for several days this week, though there were no reports of major attacks on Moscow on Friday amid a 72-hour ceasefire declared by Putin. The Soviet Union lost 27 million people in World War Two, including many millions in Ukraine, but pushed Nazi forces back to Berlin, where Hitler committed suicide and the red Soviet Victory Banner was raised over the Reichstag in 1945. Chinese Communist Party historians say China's casualties in the 1937-1945 Second Sino-Japanese War were 35 million. The Japanese occupation caused the displacement of as many as 100 million Chinese people and significant economic hardship, as well as the 1937 Nanjing Massacre, during which an estimated 100,000 to 300,000 victims were killed. Moscow and Kyiv do not publish accurate casualty numbers for the war in Ukraine, though U.S. President Donald Trump, who says he wants peace, says hundreds of thousands of soldiers on both sides have been killed and injured. Nazi Germany's unconditional surrender came into force at 11:01 p.m. on May 8, 1945, marked as \"Victory in Europe Day\" by Britain, the United States and France. In Moscow it was already May 9, which became the Soviet Union's \"Victory Day\" in what Russians call the Great Patriotic War of 1941-45. For Russians - and for many of the peoples of the former Soviet Union - May 9 is the most sacred date in the calendar, and Putin has sought to use memories of World War Two to unite Russian society, especially amid the war in Ukraine. The Kremlin says the attendance of Russian allies such as Xi, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and several dozen leaders from the former Soviet Union, Africa, Asia and Latin America shows Russia is not isolated even if Moscow's former WW2 Western allies want to stay away. Chinese troops took part in the parade, and Putin shook hands with North Korean officers, praising them for their fighting skill. North Korean troops have helped Russia fight an incursion into its western Kursk region by Ukrainian forces seeking a bargaining chip in any peace talks. Trump on Thursday called fora 30-day unconditional ceasefirebetween Russia and Ukraine, and said that if the truce was not respected then \"the U.S. and its partners will impose further sanctions.\" Putin proposed a 72-hour ceasefire that would run on May 8, May 9 and May 10, though Ukraine said Russia had broken the ceasefire, a claim dismissed as absurd by Moscow. In Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on allies to help it resist Russia, which now controls about a fifth of Ukraine. \"Evil cannot be appeased. It must be fought,\" Zelenskiy said, according to the Kyiv Post. He criticised Moscow's Victory Day parade. \"It will be a parade of cynicism. There is just no other way to describe it. A parade of bile and lies.\"",

    "title": "UniCredit board members seek M&A clarity after setbacks, sources say",
    "content": "MILAN, May 9 (Reuters) - Some UniCredit(CRDI.MI), opens new tabboard members are seeking greater clarity from CEO Andrea Orcel on his M&A plans and have asked him to explain the way forward, two sources said, after a spat with Rome delivered another setback to his ambition to grow. Months into a multi-strand acquisitions strategy, some board members are pressing Orcel for the guidance as a bid for smaller rival Banco BPM(BAMI.MI), opens new tabhangs in the balance, the sources with knowledge of the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of a Sunday board meeting at Italy's second-largest bank. UniCredit, which reports quarterly earnings on Monday, declined to comment. The bank's board gets regular updates from the CEO on his merger and acquisition strategy, a third person close to the matter separately said. Orcel, who built his reputation as a dealmaker over a three-decade career in investment banking, retains the confidence of investors who have seen UniCredit shares rise six-fold since he joined in 2021. But he finds himself in a tricky spot as his two big M&A plays for Germany's Commerzbank(CBKG.DE), opens new taband BPM(BAMI.MI), opens new tabmake little headway. Orcel has placed UniCredit at the heart of the consolidation wave sweeping Italian finance with a 14 billion euro ($16 billion) all-share offer for BPM and after buying 6.7% of insurer Generali(GASI.MI), opens new tab, which UniCredit has saidis a financial investment, like a28% stake in Commerzbank(CBKG.DE), opens new tab. The BPM bid angered Rome, which had alternative plans for the lender and last monthimposed conditionsUniCredit must meet to proceed. UniCredit has said those prescriptions could be harmful andforce it to shelve the bid. The stalemate with the government has created an unusual level of uncertainty around a bid process far advanced. The BPM offer started last week and BPM investors can tender their shares until June 23. Orcel also clashed with Germany's government when he acquired the Commerzbank stake and called for a full merger, before saying he was pausing the processuntil at least 2026. Orcel then built up this year a stake in Generali. In a move that boosts its bargaining power in an increasingly complex web of interconnected Italian M&A deals, the Milan-based bank used that 6.7% stake to weigh in at a shareholder vote on April 24 on Generali's new board and CEO. UniCredit backed a dissenting shareholder, who is a close ally of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, in his bid to appoint up to six Generali board members and sink a proposed asset management deal with France's Natixis. The government has shown no sign it will soften its stance. Orcel has repeatedly said he is ready to ditch deals if they do not meet his bar of returning at least 15%. Rome made that harder when it used 'golden power' rules designed to protect strategic assets to approve the BPM bid. Alongside other conditions, the government said UniCredit must cease operating in Russia within nine months, which would need a green light from Moscow. Orcel fell out with Italy's previous government when he decided against a deal in late 2021 to buy MPS, a nationalised bank Rome was trying to sell and more recently wanted to merge with BPM. He has failed to repair relations with Meloni's government, which is yet to respond to the objections UniCredit raised over its demands. Despite the difficulties Orcel enjoys support from investors. Two shareholders told Reuters this week they backed his approach. \"It's too early to judge where Orcel's M&A strategy is headed. His track record tells us he knows what he is doing, so I expect he will get where he wants to,\" said Andrea Scauri, a portfolio manager at Luxembourg-based Lemanik Asset Management.

    "content": "WASHINGTON/DETROIT, May 9 (Reuters) - A group representing General Motors(GM.N), opens new tab, Ford(F.N), opens new taband Stellantis(STLAM.MI), opens new tabblasted President Donald Trump's trade deal announced with the United Kingdom, saying it would harm the U.S. auto sector. British carmakers will be given a quota of 100,000 cars a year that can be sent to the United States at a 10% tariff rate, almost the total Britain exported last year, compared to 25% for Mexico and Canada and nearly all other countries. \"Under this deal, it will now be cheaper to import a UK vehicle with very little U.S. content than a USMCA compliant vehicle from Mexico or Canada that is half American parts,\" the American Automotive Policy Council, which represents the Detroit Three automakers, said on Thursday. \"This hurts American automakers, suppliers, and auto workers.\" U.S. automakers are concerned this could be a template for other agreements that could put vehicles they assemble in Canada or Mexico at a disadvantage. White House spokesperson on Friday Kush Desai defended the deal. \"No president has taken a greater personal interest in reviving the American auto industry than President Trump. The Trump administration is working hand-in-glove with automakers to reshore manufacturing that is critical to our national and economic security, including with custom-tailored tariff relief and deregulatory policies,\" he said. The automakers' group added it hopes \"this preferential access for UK vehicles over North American ones does not set a precedent for future negotiations with Asian and European competitors.\" Trump last month softened the blow of his auto tariffs by easing the impact of tariffs on parts and materials but left in place 25% tariffs on imported vehicles. He also extended a duty-free exemption for North American parts that comply with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (USMCA) rules of origin. Automakers have hoped that Trump would ease vehicle tariffs. Fordthis week confirmed it hiked prices of some Mexican-built vehicles because of tariffs and said Trump's trade warwould add about $2.5 billion in costs for 2025, but expects to reduce that exposure by around $1 billion. Rival GM said tariffs were projected to cost it between $4 billion and $5 billion, but it expected to offset that by at least 30%, while Toyota projected tariff costs for April and May at around $1.2 billion.",

    "title": "Fed officials, citing uncertainty, reiterate patient policy stance",
    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - The first wave of Federal Reserve officials to weigh in after this week's policy meeting reiterated on Friday that the current economic uncertainty calls for monetary policy patience as Trump administration trade policy boosts risks to the outlook. When it comes to the current state of Fed policy, \"we're in a good place,\" New York Fed President John Williams said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. Declining to speculate where monetary policy will go amid the uncertainty, he said, \"let's collect more data, information about what's happening with trade policy\" and its impact on the economy and then decide what that means for the Fed's next policy steps. Fed Governor Adriana Kugler, who spoke in a separate Bloomberg Television interview, said the healthy economy \"gives us time\" to make more progress lowering inflation pressures before needing to consider a next step. Both Williams and Kugler described the current state of interest rate policy as placing a modest amount of restraint on economic activity. The U.S. central bank held itsbenchmark interest ratesteady in the 4.25%-4.50% range on Wednesday and flagged the rising economic uncertainty. Speaking in a press conference after the end of the two-day policy meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, \"despite heightened uncertainty, the economy is still in a solid position,\" adding \"we believe that the current stance of monetary policy leaves us well positioned to respond in a timely way to potential economic developments.\" PresidentDonald Trump'strade policy is the key source of uncertainty for the Fed and broader economy. In a bid to bring back more manufacturing to the U.S., Trump has slammed nations around the world, particularly China, with very hightariffs. Many economists believe these import taxes will drive up inflation pressures from levels already above the Fed's 2% target. At the same time, they're likely to depress economic growth and boost unemployment. But there's little clarity on how this will all play out, with the outlook further complicated by Trump's constant tariff adjustments and assurances that a slew of trade deals are imminent. Williams, speaking at a conference in Iceland before his television interview on Friday, said \"my own view is I expect growth this year to be ... considerably slower than it was last year, inflation to be higher, unemployment ... to move up over the year.\" The potential economic impact of tariffs presents substantial challenges for the U.S. central bank's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. With monetary policy charged with keeping inflation low and the job market strong, policymakers may face difficult trade-offs in which part of the mandate most needs addressing. Fed Governor Michael Barr, in the text of a speech to the same event in Iceland, concurred with the view that tariffs could push up inflation while depressing the job market. \"The FOMC may be in a difficult position if we were to see both rising inflation and rising unemployment,\" he said. Like his colleagues, Barr said \"given the economy's strong starting point and the progress we have made in bringing inflation back toward our 2% objective, monetary policy is in a good position to adjust as conditions unfold.\" The Fed may be on track to get its first taste of how tariffs are affecting inflation on Tuesday when the U.S. government releases its Consumer Price Index for April. \"Tariffs should start to affect the inflation data in April, with clearer evidence likely in May and June,\" Bank of America economists said in a research note on Friday. \"We expect tariff-driven inflation to be temporary, but our conviction is low as there are good reasons why it could be more persistent than we expect.\" Even as Fed officials have noted a difficult trade-off balancing both sides of their mandates, they've collectively agreed that keeping inflation pressures contained is critical.",

India and Pakistanaccused each otherof launching new military attacks, using drones and artillery for the third day, in theworst fightingbetween thetwo countriesin nearly three decades. The conflict erupted after India struck multiple locations in Pakistan on Wednesday that it said were \"terrorist camps\", in retaliation for adeadly attackon Hindu tourists in Indian Kashmir last month. In the Indian state of Punjab, Amanpreet Dhillon, 26, said many families in his village — just 13 km (8.08 miles) from the border with Pakistan — have already sent women and children to safer areas. \"I am also contemplating it... I'm afraid my village could be next,\" he said. In Indian-administered Kashmir's Uri district, residents said many fled overnight after several houses were struck by shelling, some taking shelter behind rocks or in bunkers. \"We have never seen such intense shelling in our life. The majority of the people fled the town and other villages as soon as shelling started last night with some taking shelter in underground bunkers,\" said Bashir Ahmad, 45, in the town of Baramulla in Uri. \"It was a nightmare for us.\" In the Pakistani city of Lahore, which lies near the border, residents were shaken on Thursday by drones that Pakistan said were launched by India and were shot down in the city, setting off sirens and leading the U.S. consulate to tell its staff to shelter in place. Schools were closed on Friday and residents and shopkeepers said Lahoris were stocking up on food, gas cylinders for cooking and medicine, prompting authorities to issue a notice warning businesses not to artificially increase prices. \"I have stocked grocery for a month: we got meat, flour, tea, oil lentils etc and also drew extra cash from bank,\" said Aroosha Rameez, 34, a Lahore resident. Muhammad Asif, 35, said his pharmacy had seen an influx of customers. \"People in Lahore have started stocking medicines as well, which may lead to shortages of paracetamol, anti-allergies, antibiotics, blood pressure and diabetes medicines,\" he said. Food delivery app FoodPanda, popular in Pakistan, said it had seen a surge in grocery orders nationwide. Across the border, India's Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution minister warned against panic buying of food grains. \"We currently have stocks many times higher than the normal requirement—whether it is rice, wheat, or pulses...There is absolutely no shortage,\" he said. Pankaj Seth, a resident of Amritsar in India's Punjab state, said people felt they had no choice: \"We do not know if the markets will open tomorrow or not...I have children and grandchildren at home so I have to stock up.\" Some residents of border regions were also requesting relatives to bring them supplies as prices rose. \"My aunt lives in Attari and has asked me to get some flour for her as supplies are getting expensive there,\" said Navneet Kaur, a nurse in Amritsar, 30 kilometres (19 miles)away, who was travelling to the town with a sack of flour. Residents of Kashmir near the line of control that divides the region faced a more stark and immediate threat. Residents said they were starting to leave their villages and spend the nights, when shelling and firing roars through the valleys, in bunkers. The prime minister's office in Pakistan-administered Kashmir said over 400 people had been evacuated by authorities in two areas near the line of control. “Ever since the attack (Indian strike) in Muzaffarabad, we have been living in our bunker, which we carved into a nearby rocky mountain,\" said Manzoor Ahmed, 43, a resident of Jura Bandi village in the Neelum Valley, where local police confirmed most people were spending the night in bunkers.",

    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - Top U.S. oilfield service firms have signaled a challenging period ahead as a recent slide in oil prices pushes producers to temper their drilling activity and rethink their budgets. SLB(SLB.N), opens new tab, Halliburton(HAL.N), opens new tab, and Baker Hughes(BKR.O), opens new taball flagged cautious customer spending in their first-quarter reports, citing a lack of visibility, especially in North America. Higher output from the OPEC+ grouping and a global tariff war that has raised demand concerns drove crude prices to near $55 a barrel this month, from around $78 just before U.S. President Donald Trump assumed office in January. \"With oil prices falling out of the well-defined range that had persisted for much of the past 2+ years, producer budgets are encountering meaningful strain for the first time in several years,\" said Raymond James analysts. Many producers have warned that drilling becomesunprofitablebelow $65 per barrel. Brent crude was trading around $63 on Friday. Diamondback Energy(FANG.O), opens new tabtrimmed its 2025 capital budget by $400 million and said it would drill and completefewer wells, while Coterra Energy(CTRA.N), opens new tabsaid it would cut itsPermian rig count by 30%in the second half of the year. The cuts by the independent producers could potentially affect the service firms that supply them with rigs, crews, and equipment. Halliburton CEO Jeff Miller saidcustomers were reviewing2025 plans, which could lead to more idle time for fleets and, in some cases, sending equipment overseas or into retirement. Analysts at Jefferies said while delays in North American activity have now stretched into the second quarter, international projects are facing slowdowns. SLB flagged slow starts in Mexico and Saudi Arabia, and now expectsglobal upstreaminvestment to decline in 2025. Baker Hughesforecasta low double-digit drop in North American spending and mid-to-high single-digit cuts internationally. Tariffs are also adding fresh uncertainty, includingdriving up equipment costs. Halliburton forecast a 2-cents-to-3-cents per shareimpactin the second quarter from the trade tensions, while Baker Hugheswarnedof a $100 million to $200 million hit to 2025 EBITDA if tariffs stay in place. Meanwhile, all three companies are concentrating on pockets of resilience such as LNG infrastructure, power grid upgrades, and data center-driven power demand to weather a slower, more uneven recovery. Baker Hughes expects to book at least $1.5 billion of orders in data-center equipment over the next three years. \"We're really not seeing customers pull back from LNG, gas infrastructure or the data-center projects,\" said CEO Lorenzo Simonelli.",

    "content": "TIRANA, Albania, May 9 (Reuters) - Denmark's former world champion Mads Pedersen edged out Wout van Aert in a bunch sprint to win an eventful opening stage of the Giro d'Italia in Tirana on Friday. The Giro's first venture to the Balkan nation did not disappoint as the 160-km trek from Durres launched the year's first Grand Tour in style. Pedersen's Lidl-Trek teammates set a fearsome pace on the steep Surrel climb that punctuated two 22km circuits of Tirana with the sprinters all being discarded before the finale. It left Pedersen in prime position in the final kilometre and he held off a charging Van Aert (Visma-Lease a Bike) to add another notch to his already impressive resume. \"To win the stage and go into the pink jersey is absolutely amazing, especially after teamwork like this,\" Pedersen, who won the world road title in England in 2019, said. \"You always have to be afraid of Wout, he's a really good bike rider. It's not a given to win when he's in the group, and you have to handle that with respect and a bit of fear as well. But today I had the legs to finish it off for the team.\" Pedersen will begin Saturday's 13km time trial wearing the leader's jersey for the first time in a Grand Tour. Van Aert was left frustrated that he could not mark his Giro d'Italia debut by winning the first stage. \"There are only a few opportunities to take the pink jersey. So that's why I really wanted to try -- on the last climb, I suffered so much to just hang on,\" Van Aert said. \"So it's a pity to finish second, but it's still better than expected.\" The opening day was not without drama as the fancied Juan Ayuso (UAE Team Emirates) crashed early on a roundabout but was unhurt and finished safely in the pack alongside race favourite Primoz Roglic (Red Bull–Bora–Hansgrohe). There was far worse news for another contender for the overall victory though as Ayuso's fellow Spaniard Mikel Landa went down heavily with 5km remaining and was taken away on a stretcher with his hopes over. Two other riders expected to challenge for the maglia rosa -- Derek Gee (Israel-Premier Tech) and Thymen Arensman (Ineos Grenadiers) -- lost time on a punishing day. Sylvain Moniquet (Cofidis), who was part of an escape group for much of the day, leads the early climber's category.",

    "title": "Pope Leo faces packed schedule, inherits many events from Francis",
    "content": "VATICAN CITY, May 9 (Reuters) -Pope Leo XIVhas only been in the job one day and already faces a packed schedule of religious services, diplomatic meetings and Holy Year events, many of which were organised for his predecessor Francis. Afterpresiding over a Masswith cardinals in the Sistine Chapel on Friday, his next expected public engagement will be a meeting with cardinals on Saturday followed by midday (1000 GMT) prayers on Sunday from the main balcony of St. Peter's Basilica. The formal inauguration Mass - for the first U.S. pontiff in the 2,000-year history of the Roman Catholic Church - will be held in St. Peter's Square on May 18, the Vatican announced. Other early commitments will include taking possession of Rome's three basilicas -- St. Paul Outside the Walls on May 20, and St. John Lateran and Santa Maria Maggiore (Saint Mary Major), where Francis is buried, on May 25. Before all this, the new pope will meet on May 12 with the thousands of journalists who covered the conclave, and on May 16 he will hold an audience with diplomats accredited to the Holy See, the world's smallest independent state. His first weekly general audience with the faithful is set for May 21. Adding to the early workload is the continuation of the2025 Holy Year, also known as a Jubilee, which traditionally occurs every 25 years, drawing millions of pilgrims to Rome for a continuous stream of events. Leo inherits celebrations for that from Francis, who died on April 21 at the age of 88. Special meetings to celebrate specific groups special to the Church, such as choirs, families and the clergy, are planned from May to the end of the year, including a major youth jubilee from July 28 to August 3. One of the highlights of the 2025 Catholic calendar is the canonisation of the first saint of the millennial generation,Carlo Acutis. It was set for April 27, but had to be postponed because of Francis' death. A new date has to be fixed. New popes can make a huge impression on their first trips abroad and it will be up to Leo to decide his priorities. But he will have to make a quick decision whether to fulfil a commitment made by Francis to visit Turkey later this month to celebrate the 1,700th anniversary of a major Christian council of bishops in ancient Nicaea, now the modern-day town of Iznik. Going ahead with this trip would mean Leo would swiftly get to see Patriarch Bartholomew, the spiritual leader of the Eastern Orthodox Church -- a meeting that would symbolize a renewed commitment to Christian unity. Leo will also inherit the ongoing Synod on Synodality -- a global consultation process launched by Francis in 2021 with the aim of making the Church more inclusive and collaborative. Ten working groups are due to present findings in June on sensitive topics such as women's roles in the Church. In March, Francis had extended the process through 2028.",

    "content": "LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Britain has more than doubled funding available under a scheme seeking to spur investment in offshore wind projects to 544 million pounds ($721.78 million), after higher than expected demand, the government said on Friday. The country has put offshore wind at the heart of its 2030 clean energy plan and hopes to boost capacity from around 15 GW at present to 43-50 GW by the end of the decade. But there are worries it could miss targets after one of the largest projects in development,Orsted's Hornsea 4 project, was cancelled this week. The Danish company said it was no longer economic to proceed given rising building costs. An expansion of the investment incentive scheme which the government calls the 'Clean Industry Bonus' from an initial budget of 200 million pounds to 544 million pounds could help improve the financial viability of new projects. The scheme will help underpin the economics of projects bidding in Britain's nextannual renewable subsidyauction which will be held later this year. Successful bidders in the Clean Industry Bonus will receive an initial 27 million pounds in funding for every gigawatt (GW) of capacity from offshore wind projects. It is open to developers investing in regions that need it most or in cleaner supply chains, including traditional oil and gas communities, ex-industrial areas and ports and coastal towns, the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) said. \"This additional funding has the potential to help secure billions in private investment in new factories manufacturing components for the offshore wind industry across the UK,\" Ana Musat, Executive Director of Policy at industry group RenewableUK said in the government statement.

    "title": "Cardinals offer glimpses into path Pope Leo XIV will follow",
    "content": "VATICAN CITY, May 9 (Reuters) - With the world still wondering how thefledgling papacyof Leo XIV will take wing, cardinals and other clerics gave glimpses into his background and his views on social issues on Friday, while carefully maintaining the secrecy of the conclave. German Cardinal Reinhard Marx said thatRobert Prevost, elected pope on Thursday, had a breadth of experience, cultural knowledge and language skills from his time in the U.S. and Peru that made him a good fit for the role. \"That convinced me to say that this could be a possibility. That's why I'm very happy in the end, I can tell you,\" Marx told reporters. Born in Chicago, Prevost worked for decades in Peru and is a dual U.S.-Peruvian citizen. Besides English and Spanish, he also speaks French, Italian, a bit of German and understands Latin. \"He spoke his first word on peace. I think that was an important word, which he made clear once again,\" Marx added, referring tocomments the new pope madefrom St. Peter's Basilica on Thursday. The German cardinal said Leo would continue to speak out against conflict and violence, following the example of Pope Francis. \"There has to be another voice, and I think that's what is expected,\" he added. President Donald Trumphailed the appointmentof the first U.S. pope, butsocial media postsshow that Leo challenged U.S. policies on issues such as migration when he was a cardinal. \"As the pope, he certainly won't want to provoke there, in that direction,\" Marx said, referring to relations with Trump, but adding that Leo would be prepared to take a stand when necessary. A senior member of Prevost's Augustinian religious order said he thought the new pope would be less impulsive than his predecessor Francis, who had a reputation for forthright, off-the-cuff comments. \"Pope Francis would speak what was on his mind immediately. I think what we'll see with Pope Leo is a man who wants to think first and process what is the message he wants to deliver. And then deliver it,\" Rev. Joseph Farrell, Vicar General of the Order of St. Augustine, told Reuters in an interview. \"I think that's an attractive aspect of somebody who's going to be in leadership and servant leadership in the church,\" said Farrell, who is not a cardinal and was not in the conclave. Farrell has known the pope since the mid-1980s and last saw him for lunch on Tuesday, the day before the 133 cardinal electors locked themselves in the Sistine Chapel for the secret conclave election. Prevost had been touted in the media as a possible candidate for the papacy, albeit not a frontrunner. \"We asked him, you know, how are you doing with all of this? He said, well, to be honest, I'm not sleeping as well as I used to,\" Farrell said, adding that the future pontiff prayed with his Augustinian brothers and felt \"a little emotional\". The most important decision a new pope has to make is what they should be called, and Prevost gave an important indication of his priorities when he opted for Leo. \"His name is his programme,\" said Serbian Cardinal Ladislav Nemet, archbishop of Belgrade, who dined with the new pope on Thursday night. The last pope to take the name Leo, Leo XIII, focused much of his 1878-1903 papacy on advocating for the rights of workers, calling for better pay, fair working conditions, and the right to join unions. Nemet told HRT Croatian Radio and Television that the subject of the name came up at the dinner conversation that he and other cardinals had with the new pope. \"And it's very interesting, he said he wants to give more attention to issues of social order in the world, like issues of justice,\" Nemet told an HRT correspondent, who provided Reuters with a transcript of his comments. \"(The pope) also said that we are inside a new revolution: in Leo XIII's time there was an industrial revolution going on, now there is a digital revolution going on. \"Today, as in Leo XIII's time, there is the problem of jobs, because digitisation leads to a decrease in labour needed for work,\" Nemet said.",

    "content": "BRASILIA, May 9 (Reuters) - Brazil is in talks with China to build a railway connecting the Chinese-built mega Chancay port in Peru to Brazilian regions, Planning Minister Simone Tebet said on Friday. \"They are very interested in helping Brazil, in crisscrossing the country with railways,\" Tebet told local outlet Carta Capital in an interview. Chinese President Xi Jinping attended theinaugurationof the deepwater port in November. The $1.3 billion Chancay project is Beijing's largest investment in South America and part of its push to expand trade and influence across the continent. Tebet said her team met just over a month ago with a Chinese group representing the country's state-owned railway company to discuss a potential route linking the port to Brazil, based on the view that Chancay lies on the shortest path to China, cutting maritime trade distance by at least 10,000 kilometers (6,210 miles). Initially, the Chinese side had considered a route through the Amazon region, but the Brazilian government firmly rejected the idea due to the presence of the rainforest and indigenous peoples, Tebet said. \"They ended up understanding, after a full analysis, and the idea now is to chart a southern route,\" she said, noting that the railway would pass through the states of Acre and Tocantins, eventually reaching Bahia and connecting to the West-East Integration Railway (FIOL). The FIOL railway, which remains under construction, will stretch about 1,527 kilometers from Figueiropolis in Tocantins to the Atlantic port of Ilheus in Bahia. Tebet acknowledged that the project would take time to materialize but said it would be transformative for economic development in Brazil's poorer interior regions. \"You could be talking about five years, maybe eight, to see a project like this completed,\" she added.",

The incident came days after Oman said it mediated a ceasefire deal between the U.S. and the Houthis, withthe Yemeni groupsaying the accord did not include close U.S. ally Israel. The Iran-aligned militia group claimed responsibility for Friday's attack, saying it fired a ballistic missile towards Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, according to the group's military spokesperson Yahya Saree. Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said after the military reported the missile launch that Israel would respond forcefully in Yemen and \"wherever necessary\", describing the Houthi missiles as \"Iranian\". President Donald Trump announcedon Tuesdaythat the U.S. would stop bombing the Houthis in Yemen as the group had agreed to stop attacking U.S. ships. But the Houthis have continued to fire missiles and drones towards Israel, most of which the Israeli military says it has intercepted, without casualties or serious damage occurring. The Houthis have attacked numerous vessels in the Red Sea, disrupting global trade, in a campaign that they say is aimed at showing solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Israel has been fighting a war in Gaza since a deadly raid by Palestinian militant group Hamas into southern Israel in October 2023. The Houthis are part of Iran's so-called \"Axis of Resistance\" against Israeli and U.S. interests in the Middle East, a group also including Hamas and Lebanon's Hezbollah. Israel has weakened those groups by assassinating top leaders and destroying military infrastructure since the Gaza war began, though Houthi capabilities appear largely intact.",

    "title": "For US Cardinal Prevost, road to becoming Pope Leo was paved in Peru",
    "content": "VATICAN CITY, May 9 (Reuters) -Cardinal Robert Prevostmay be the first person from the U.S. to become the head of the Catholic Church but his surprising election by the world's cardinals as Pope Leo XIV probably had less to do with his birthplace than his former workplace. Prevost, a relative unknownon the world stage, spent two decades as amissionary in Peruand became a senior Vatican official and a cardinal only in 2023. His first assignment as a bishop was in Chiclayo, in northwest Peru, where he served from 2015 to 2023. For the 133 cardinals locked in conclave in the Sistine Chapel to pick a successor toPope Francis, an Argentine and the first pontiff from the Americas, this was likely no small detail. \"For us, he's the second Latin American pope,\" Fernando Morales-de la Cruz, a Guatemalan human rights activist, told Reuters. Prevost has dual U.S.-Peruvian nationality. But unlike Francis, who was elected pope in 2013 after serving for decades as a local bishop and had no Vatican experience, Prevost was not a complete outsider. He spent the last two years leading the powerful Vatican office that helps decide which priests are appointed as Catholic bishops across the world. He also took part in two Vatican assemblies of global bishops hosted by Francis in 2023 and 2024. With his combined experiences, he becomes pope with a head start onsome of the big issuesfacing the 1.4 billion-member Church and is already well known by many of the cardinals. Given the secrecy of the conclave, not much will be known at least for now about the thinking of the cardinal-electors and how their rounds of voting went up to the moment they made their choice on Thursday. But some analysts have some theories, including about how Prevost overcame what was until now thought to be an unlikely proposition: a U.S. cardinal becoming pope. \"Before the conclave, the American cardinals thought a U.S. passport was a dealbreaker,\" said Michael Sean Winters, a U.S. commentator who has followed the Vatican closely. But cardinals decided that Prevost's nationality, given his experience in Latin America, \"was not an insuperable barrier\", he said. \"What they wanted was someone known among the other cardinals and also committed to carrying on with Francis' reforms,\" said Winters. \"And more than any other papal contender Prevost had both things.\" In Donald Trump's second U.S. presidency, the cardinals may have also seen real value for the first time in elevating another American as pope. Francis was asharp critic of Trump, saying earlier this year that the president's plan to deport millions of migrants in the U.S. was a \"disgrace\". \"As for why the cardinals picked (Prevost), I have to wonder if elevating a 'different sort of American leader' wasn't a part of the discernment process,\" said Natalia Imperatori-Lee, a U.S. academic and Catholic expert at Manhattan University in New York. Heading into the conclave on Wednesday, two other cardinals were seen as leading frontrunners:Italian Pietro ParolinandFilipino Luis Antonio Tagle. Cardinals vote in conclaves once on the first day and four times on subsequent days. Whenwhite smoke billowedfrom a chimney atop the Sistine Chapel at 6:08 p.m. (1608 GMT) on Thursday, signalling the election of the new pope, many watching thought it must be either Parolin or Tagle. The timing of the smoke meant the new pope was probably elected on the fourth ballot of the conclave, a fast result. Francis was elected on the fifth ballot of the 2013 conclave. In 1978, it took eight ballots to elect Pope John Paul II. Like Prevost, the Polish Cardinal Karol Wojtyla had not been seen as a frontrunner heading into the conclave that made him pontiff. One cardinal - who was not able to participate in this conclave because he is over the age of 80 - said that based on his experience in past conclaves, a consensus probably emerged on the third ballot that on the next round Prevost would reach the two-thirds majority required to win election. The third ballot would have been the second one held on Thursday morning, before the cardinals took a break for lunch. The retired cardinal, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the secretive process, suggested that Prevost may have taken time in the lunch break to choose his papal name and begin drafting his first address as leader of the Church. When Pope Leo appeared for the first time on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, about 70 minutes after his election, to greet tens of thousands in the square below, he spokefrom a written text. None of the past four popes used a written text for their first address from the balcony. In 2013, Francis' first word was simply \"Buonasera\" (Good evening), and he spoke extemporaneously for just a few minutes. Asked by a reporter with Italy's Channel 4 two days before the conclave if he would be elected as pope, Prevost replied: \"Everything is in the hands of the Holy Spirit\". The reporter then mentioned how the cardinal had a range of experiences he could offer as pope, being born in the U.S., living in Peru, and knowing bishops around the globe because of his Vatican job. \"All of this is true, yes,\" Prevost replied.",

    "content": "GENEVA, May 9 (Reuters) - Switzerland and the United States have agreed to accelerate theirtrade talksand are determined to reach an agreement quickly, Swiss President Karin Keller-Sutter said on Friday, without specifying a time frame. U.S. President Donald Trump has upended global commerce by imposing tariffs aimed at shrinking the U.S. trade deficit in goods. Switzerland is among the countries seeking to strike a quick deal to reduce those tariffs, and Keller-Sutter said it was towards the front of the line after \"positive\" discussions. \"We both actually made a commitment today that the process would be accelerated,\" Keller-Sutter told reporters in Geneva, saying she was summarising what was agreed in her meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and chief U.S. trade negotiator Jamieson Greer in Geneva. \"Both sides are determined to find a solution quickly.

Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday announced a limitedbilateral trade agreementthat leaves Trump's 10% rate there in place, modestly expands agricultural access for both countries and lowers prohibitive U.S. duties on British car exports. \"The U.S. side was quite clear about the fact that they wanted to accelerate the process with Switzerland. They couldn't guarantee we would come second (after Britain) but that we would really be in a group of countries that are now treated swiftly,\" Keller-Sutter said, adding she could not give a time frame.",

    "content": "May 9 - After a couple weeks of browsing, New York Giants first-round pick Abdul Carter selected the No. 51 jersey off the rack of available digits on Friday. The 21-year-old outside linebacker, the No. 3 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, flirted with the idea of wearing the retired jersey numbers of a couple of Hall of Famers before making his choice. Franchise legend Lawrence Taylor rebuffed Carter's request to bring his No. 56 out of retirement, politely telling the rookie to \"be the player that he is.\" \"He can't be another Lawrence Taylor,\" Taylor said to ESPN two days after the draft. \"Well, he may be better than a Lawrence Taylor, who knows. But he has to make his mark. It's up to him.\" Carter then pivoted to No. 11, the number he wore as an All-American and Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year at Penn State. That jersey number also is retired by New York in honor of quarterback Phil Simms, who said he initially was receptive to the idea. However, he was \"outvoted\" by his family, he told the New York Daily News. That rejection prompted Carter to make a joke about whether he would ever find a number. \"Damn at this point imma be out there with just my last name on my jersey, no number (laughing emojis),\" Carter posted on X. \"Jkjk, It's all Love. Just wanna play Football!\" Linebacker Azeez Ojulari wore No. 51 from 2021-24 but signed with the Philadelphia Eagles during the offseason. The most decorated player in Giants history to wear the number was two-time Super Bowl champion and two-time Pro Bowl long snapper Zak DeOssie from 2007-19. The Giants announced the jersey numbers for the rest of their rookie class: QB Jaxson Dart (6), DT Darius Alexander (91), RB Cam Skattebo (44), OL Marcus Mbow (71), TE Thomas Fidone II (86) and CB Korie Black (25). --Field Level Media",

    "title": "Enbridge beats Q1 profit estimates on Mainline and gas distribution growth",
    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - Canadian pipeline operator Enbridge(ENB.TO), opens new tabexceeded market estimates for first-quarter profit on Friday, driven in part by higher earnings from its Mainline crude pipeline system which it said customers want to see expanded in spite of lower oil prices. The Calgary, Alberta-based company's Mainline system is the largest pipeline system in North America, moving crude from Western Canada to markets in Eastern Canada and the U.S. Midwest. Enbridge said the Mainline system was full to capacity the entire first quarter, delivering a first-quarter record of 3.2 million barrels per day. The Mainline saw a rise in first-quarter adjusted core profit to C$1.45 billion, from C$1.34 billion last year. Enbridge has been in talks with customers to add incremental capacity along the existing Mainline pipeline network to meet growing demand for oil export capacity from Canada. The company forecasts the need for around 1 million barrels per day of additional pipeline space out of Western Canada by 2035 as the country's oil sands operators increase production. Enbridge expects to make a final investment decision on the first phase of its Mainline project — which would add 150,000 barrels per day of capacity to the network and would include an expansion of the Flanagan South pipeline, a 954-km segment that runs from Illinois to Cushing, Oklahoma — later this year, CEO Greg Ebel said on a conference call. Ebel said the bullish stance on the need for additional oil pipeline capacity in North America has not changed, in spite of a significant decline in oil prices this spring. \"Those shorter-term swings, which we watch very closely, can have some impact on production but they don't change the long-term view of energy demand and need,\" Ebel said. Enbridge also saw a rise in earnings from its gas distribution unit to C$1.60 billion ($1.15 billion), from C$765 million last year. Enbridge, along with I Squared and MPLX(MPLX.N), opens new tab, announced a deal on May 6 toacquire up to 85%of the Matterhorn Express gas pipeline, a deal that will see the company continue to build its footprint in the U.S. Permian basin. Enbridge, which said it expects to have an equity interest in 30% of the total natural gas pipeline capacity in the Permian by 2025, is paying close attention to how operators in that basin are responding to the lower pricing environment. Some companies in the Permian are already beginning to drop drilling rigs in light of the lower oil prices. But Ebel said the contracted nature of Enbridge's pipeline business will help to shelter it from any slowdown in production activity in the region. Enbridge reported adjusted profit of C$1.03 per share for the quarter ended March 31, beating analysts' average expectation of 96 Canadian cents per share, according to data compiled by LSEG.

    "title": "French pro-Palestinian group contests government decision to shut it down",
    "content": "PARIS, May 9 (Reuters) - A French pro-Palestinian protest group is contesting a government decision to shut it down, saying the move was politically motivated and based on \"false\" arguments as part of a wider crackdown on the movement for Palestinian rights. Urgence Palestine (Emergency Palestine), created in 2023 to protest against Israel's military offensive in Gaza, filed its counterarguments to the shutdown procedure on Thursday, their lawyer Elsa Marcel said. French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau, explaining the decision, said in a letter dated April 28 to one of the group's founders, Omar Alsoumi, that Urgence Palestine had provoked violent acts, including towards Jewish people, and had called for armed struggle. Asked about the decision, Alsoumi told Reuters on Friday: \"This shows the partiality of the French government on the genocidal war that the Palestinian people is experiencing.\" He said the group, which has been organising protests across France over the past 19 months, rejects any conflation of Jews and the Israeli government and that Palestinians have the right to resist occupation under international law. The French Interior Ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Last week Retailleau said the move against Urgence Palestine was necessary to \"crack down on Islamists\". \"We must not deform the Palestinians' just cause,\" he said in an interview with CNews/Europe 1 on April 30. The group's lawyer Marcel said the closure was part of a wider wave of repression in Western countries against pro-Palestinian, anti-war activists. \"There is an extremely elastic use of the question of terrorism apology, which we contest, and criticism of Israel is represented as antisemitism, which we also contest,\" she said. Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed more than 52,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, according to Hamas-run health authorities. The offensive was triggered by a Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies. Surges in violence in the Israel-Palestinian conflict have often fuelled racist incidents in France. The number of antisemitic and Islamophobic acts rose by 284% and 29%respectively in 2023, France's human rights commission said.",

Waller, citing earlier research of his own and others, said the U.S. central bank's system provides electoral accountability by letting every U.S. president who serves a four-year term appoint some members of the seven-person Board of Governors, while the lengthy terms of up to 14 years allow objective, non-partisan policymaking. That setup is more likely to produce better policy outcomes, with lower inflation and less economic volatility. Economic stability is \"enhanced by having a group of individuals set policy who could not be removed from office,\" said Waller, a former research director at the St. Louis Fed who was appointed as a Fed governor during PresidentDonald Trump'sfirst term in the White House. \"This structure is the one that we have in place today at the Federal Reserve,\" Waller told a monetary policy conference at Stanford University's Hoover Institution. \"I would argue that it has stood the test of time, and I hope that it continues to be in place for years to come.\" His comments follow what seemed to be threats by Trump earlier this year to try to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell, though the president has sincebacked down. The Fed is closely monitoring a case before the U.S. Supreme Court to see if Trump is allowed to fire officials at other independent agencies.

    "title": "Inside China's decision to come to the table on Trump tariffs",
    "content": "BEIJING, May 9 (Reuters) - Since U.S. President Donald Trump imposed steep tariffs on China last month, Beijing has responded in kind. On state and social media, it posted images of Mao Zedong, lambasted \"imperialists,\" and sent a message: capitulation to bullies is dangerous, and it wouldn't back down. But behind closed doors, Chinese officials have grown increasingly alarmed about tariffs' impact on the economy and the risk of isolation as China's trading partners have started negotiating deals with Washington, according to three officials familiar with Beijing's thinking. These factors, along with outreach by the U.S. and an easing of Trump's rhetoric, persuaded Beijing to send its economic tsar He Lifengfor meetings with U.S. counterparts in Switzerlandthis weekend, the officials told Reuters. Re-engagement was complicated by the fractious nature of U.S.-China diplomacy. In particular, Beijing considered a letter the U.S. side sent to Chinese ministries in late April about fentanyl \"arrogant,\" two officials said. Efforts to arrange talks were further impaired by disagreements over which officials should be involved, said one of these people and another official. China's reasons for deciding to negotiate, Washington's letter on fentanyl, U.S. diplomatic challenges in Beijing, and the early outreach between the two sides are reported by Reuters for the first time, based on interviews with nearly a dozen government officials and experts on both sides. Most of the people were granted anonymity to discuss non-public information. China's foreign ministry said in a statement to Reuters that it reiterated that \"China's firm opposition to the U.S. abuse of tariffs is consistent and clear, and there is no change.\" \"The U.S. has ignored China's goodwill and unreasonably imposed tariffs on China under the pretext of fentanyl. This is a typical act of bullying, which seriously undermines dialogue and cooperation between the two sides in the field of drug control.\" China's State Council and ministry of commerce, and the White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In response to Reuters' questions about the lead-up to the Geneva talks, the U.S. State Department said it and the U.S. Embassy in Beijing \"continue to regularly engage Chinese counterparts to advance the interests of the American people.\" China's Vice Foreign Minister Hua Chunyingsaid on Fridaythat China has full confidence in its ability to manage U.S. trade issues, adding that the Trump administration's approach cannot be sustained. The trade war between the world's two largest economies, combined with Trump's decision last month to impose duties on dozens of other countries, has disrupted supply chains, unsettled financial markets and stoked fears of a sharp downturn in global growth. Chinese export restrictions, meanwhile, have squeezed the supply of critical minerals the U.S. needs for weapons, electronics and consumer goods. Trump'sapproval ratings are fallingdue to his handling of tariffs and the economy. The volatile run-up to the Geneva talks underscores the deep mistrust and divergent negotiating styles between the Trump team and China, which could make for protracted and fraught discussions. \"Both sides I think are balancing trying to look tough with not wanting to be responsible for sinking the global economy,\" said Scott Kennedy, an expert in Chinese business affairs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. \"The Chinese set a high bar for these talks, but it became increasingly clear that the Trump administration wanted to talk, and they couldn't say no forever. So, they've accepted what are probably best seen as pre-negotiations in Geneva.\" After Trump's tariff salvo last month, China took a hard line in its public messaging. Beijing posted footage on its official social media feeds of a Chinese MiG-15 fighter shooting down a U.S. jet in the Korean War, with commentary: \"China won't kneel down, because we know standing up for ourselves keeps the possibility of cooperation alive, while compromise snuffs it out.\" The tone began to shift on April 30, when a state media-affiliated blog said the U.S. had \"proactively reached out to China through multiple channels, hoping to discuss tariffs.\" CSIS's Kennedy said contacts between Chinese agencies, Beijing's embassy in Washington and the Trump administration had been increasing in frequency in recent weeks. Some in-person interactions took place at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in late April, including with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, which paved the way for the Swiss meeting, said Kennedy. After Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, Chinese Commerce Minister Wang Wentao quietly reached out to his U.S. counterpart, Howard Lutnick, but was rebuffed as not senior enough, according to one official familiar with the exchanges. Trump has been pushing for direct talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping. But China has rejected that idea as not in keeping with its traditional approach of working out the details first before the leaders sign any deal, according to public statements by both sides. Another significant factor for China was Trump'spublic beratingof Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in February, said one of the sources, adding that any unscripted hostile interaction between the U.S. and Chinese leaders would represent an unacceptable loss of face for Xi. As messaging on both sides grew more conciliatory, China decided to put forward itsvice premier and Xi confidant He Lifeng, whose direct predecessor struck the \"Phase One\" trade deal with the U.S. in 2019. The move satisfied Washington's demands for substantive talks with a senior official with direct access to Xi, but avoided exposing the Chinese leader to potential embarrassment, said one of the sources. As for the choice of venue, the Swiss foreign ministry said that \"during its recent contacts in Washington and Beijing, Switzerland expressed to the U.S. and Chinese authorities its willingness to organize a meeting between the two parties in Geneva.\" Among the main drivers of Beijing's climb-down were internal signals that Chinese companies were struggling to avoid bankruptcies and to replace the U.S. market, three people familiar with the Chinese government's thinking said. Some areas feeling immediate impact were furniture and toy makers, as well as textiles, said one of the officials. U.S. diplomats in China have also been closely monitoring factory closures, strikes, and job losses in the industrial heartland in southern China. Many analysts have downgraded their 2025 economic growth forecasts for China, and investment bank Nomura has warned the trade war could cost it up to 16 million jobs. China's central bank this week announcedfresh monetary stimulus. One of the officials said Chinese companies were struggling to replace the U.S. market because developing nations cannot buy as many items, and that for many firms this was an existential threat that needed to be resolved in days or weeks. In addition, Beijing was worried it was left without a place at the negotiating table while its major trading partners, such as Vietnam, India and Japan, began talks with Washington, said two officials familiar with Beijing's thinking. In a warning to the countries negotiating with the U.S., China's commerce ministry said in a statement this week that \"appeasement cannot bring peace, compromise cannot be respected, and adhering to principled positions and upholding fairness and justice is the right way to safeguard one's own interests.\" As part of the push to counter the U.S.,China is sendingits Premier Li Qiang to Malaysia in late May for a summit with a newly established group of Southeast Asian and Arab nations, two sources told Reuters. A regional diplomat based in Beijing told Reuters China's message to Southeast Asia was \"We will buy stuff from you.\" In Geneva, Beijing appears to have modest expectations. Internally, China has downgraded the talks from a higher level to merely a meeting, reflecting its view that the discussions will be mostly about finding out Washington's demands and red lines after weeks of contradictory messages by Trump and other senior U.S. officials, according to a person familiar with the matter. Still, one official said China could draw on its extensive toolbox andfollow Asian neighborsinofferingto buy more American liquefied natural gas. On the table may also be purchases of agricultural goods, similar to the 2019 \"Phase One\" deal during Trump's first term. At the time, Beijingsaid it wouldincrease purchases of U.S. agricultural products by $32 billion over two years. While other matters like the U.S.'s axing of the \"de minimis\" exemption for packages under $800 from China and the sale of TikTok are also likely to play a part in the broader talks, Chinese officials said they do not expect them to play a central role this weekend. Even before triggering the broader trade war, Trump imposed a 20% tariff on Chinese goods, saying Beijing wasn't doing enough to counter the flow of chemicals used to produce the deadly drug fentanyl. One of the moves that complicated the rapprochement, according to two officials, was a letter sent by the U.S. to China in late April that outlined the steps Trump wanted Beijing to take on fentanyl. The document, reviewed by Reuters, caused friction with Beijing because it referenced acongressional reportthat asserted China, through value-added tax rebates for exporters, directly subsidizes production of fentanyl precursors for sale abroad. China denies it does so. The letter, sent to the ministries of foreign affairs, commerce, and public security, called on Beijing to publicize the crackdown on fentanyl precursors on the front page of the Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily; send a similar message through \"internal party channels\" to party members; tighten regulation of some specified chemicals; and deepen law-enforcement cooperation. Two officials familiar with China's reaction said it found especially the first two points \"arrogant\" because Beijing saw it as the U.S. dictating what China should do within its ruling apparatus. One said fentanyl would feature in the Geneva talks and that the U.S. government's opening position would be to present the four points to China. A U.S. official familiar with the letter said the Trump administration simply wanted China to curb the flow of fentanyl precursors to drug cartels. Complicating the negotiations, Trump's Washington team has frozen out many U.S. embassy officials responsible for earlier contacts with Chinese counterparts, two people familiar with the matter said. Trump's new ambassador to China, David Perdue, is slated to arrive in Beijing next week, but Deputy Chief of Mission Sarah Beran, who served as a senior official on China in the Biden administration's National Security Council, was removed from her post this week, the two officials said. The turmoil has resulted in lack of internal consultations on demands put forward by the American side, the officials said. An official familiar with Chinese thinking said there had been minimal contact with the U.S. embassy ahead of the Geneva talks. A State Department official told Reuters in response to questions that Beran's \"upcoming departure from Beijing is a routine personnel change, and does not reflect the current state of the U.S.-China bilateral relationship.\"",

    "title": "New Pope Leo XIV, celebrating first Mass, wants Church to be beacon of light",
    "content": "VATICAN CITY, May 9 (Reuters) - Pope Leo XIV celebrated his first Mass on Friday in the Sistine Chapel wherehe was electedless than 24 hours earlier, warning of the dangers caused by a lack of faith and hoping the Catholic Church could be a beacon lighting the world's \"dark nights\". Leo, the formerCardinal Robert Prevostand the first U.S. pope, looked calm as he delivered the Mass in the famous, frescoed chapel with the samecardinals who chose himto be the 267th pontiff and the successor to Pope Francis. Dressed in relatively simple white and gold vestments, Leo, who wasborn in Chicagobut spent two decades as a missionary in Peru, said a few words in English before continuing his homily in fluent Italian. In the homily, Leo, 69, painted a picture of the Church he would like to see, saying he would seek to serve as the \"faithful administrator\" for the Church as a whole. The new pope, who leads 1.4 billion Catholics around the world, acknowledged that the Christian faith is sometimes \"considered absurd\" and the preserve of \"the weak and unintelligent\". \"A lack of faith is often tragically accompanied by the loss of meaning in life, the neglect of mercy, appalling violations of human dignity, the crisis of the family and so many other wounds that afflict our society,\" he said. An inauguration Mass for Leo will be held in St. Peter's Square on Sunday May 18, the Vatican said. World and religious leaders are invited to the inauguration, which marks the formal launch of a papacy. Pope Francis' inauguration in 2013 attracted a crowd estimated at 200,000 people. The new pope will also leave senior Vatican officials in their roles for the time being, giving him time to decide before making definitive appointments, the Vatican said. All Vatican senior officials, appointed for five-year terms, serve at the pleasure of the pope. A new pontiff usually rolls over existing mandates at least initially before deciding whether to change key positions. The pope was elected at the end of a two-day conclave that was wrapped up on Thursday evening when white smoke billowed from the chimney on the Sistine Chapel. Given the nature of the conclaves, when cardinals are shut away from the world and sworn to secrecy, little or nothing is likely to emerge - at least for now - about how Leo obtained the required two-thirds majority of the vote so swiftly. The successor to Pope Francis, who died last month at the age of 88, inherits a number ofmajor challenges, ranging from a budget shortfall to divisions over whether the Church should be more welcoming towards the LGBT community and divorcees, and should let women play a greater role in its affairs. He will also have a packed agenda, with the Vatican celebrating aHoly Yearthat brings millions of additional tourists to Rome. Before Leo's election, U.S. cardinals had largely been written off as papal contenders because of a widespread assumption that the global Church could not be run by a superpower pope. However, he also holds Peruvian citizenship, meaning that he has deep knowledge of both the West and less developed nations. U.S. President Donald Trump was quick to congratulate Leo. However, the new pope has a history ofcriticizing Trumpand Vice President JD Vance's policies, according to posts on the X account of Robert Prevost. Leo worked for decades in the north of Peru, first as a missionary and later as Bishop of Chiclayo from 2015 to 2023. Catholicstook to the streetsof the small city in northwestern Peru, and church bells rang out to celebrate the election of a man who they embrace as one of their own. One of the clues to what kind of a Church leader Leo will be was in his choice of name. The last pope with this name was Leo XIII, who led the Church from 1878-1903. He was known for his devoted focus to social justice issues. Prevost became a cardinal only in 2023. He has givenfew media interviewsand is known to have a shy personality. Francis brought him to Rome two years ago to head the Vatican office in charge of choosing which priests should serve as Catholic bishops, meaning he has had a hand in selecting many of the world's bishops.",

    "content": "LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - The removal of UK tariffs on U.S. ethanol in the U.S.-UK trade deal could sound the death knell for Associated British Foods'(ABF.L), opens new tabloss-making bioethanol plant at Hull, northern England, following a warning last month that its future was uncertain. Thetrade deal, announced on Thursday, will reduce Britain's 19% tariffs on U.S. ethanol to zero through a 1.4 billion-litre (370 million gallon) quota that far exceeds U.S. exports to the UK last year. AB Foods' CEO George Weston told Reuters on April 29 that the group's ethanol business had faced \"significant problems\" with \"effectively subsidised imports\". The group, which also owns Primark and a host of grocery brands including Twinings and Ovaltine, said the way in which UK regulations were being applied to bioethanol was undermining the commercial viability of its Vivergo plant in Hull which produces bioethanol fuel for cars and animal feed. AB Foods is calling for changes to UK bioethanol regulations regarding imports. It warned that unless talks with government \"improve the position\" it could mothball or close the plant, putting about 150 jobs at risk. \"We're very clear what we need to do with the ethanol business - that's a regulatory issue that we need government support on.\" However, the opening up of the UK ethanol market to U.S. producers means the business now faces a new challenge. \"The government's last-minute decision to allow tariff-free ethanol imports from the U.S. into the UK is causing great anxiety to many people in the northeast of England, not least to the many employees and suppliers and farmers involved in the UK bioethanol industry,\" an AB Foods spokesperson said on Friday. They added that the company was working through the detail and \"the implications\" with the government. Britain's National Farmers' Unionwarnedon Thursday the ethanol measure could mean the loss of a profitable outlet for arable growers which supply the industry. The Renewable Energy Association warned that the deal could enable U.S. producers, supported by U.S. tax credits, to sell into Britain at a cheaper rate than domestic suppliers can match. INEOS closed its ethanol plant at its Grangemouth site in Scotland in January, blaming a reduction in demand for ethanol in Europe combined with increasing pressure from imports of ethanol from other regions. Britain's concession on ethanol and beef was made in return for the U.S. removal of 25% additional tariffs on steel and aluminium, and a quota of 100,000 cars at a duty of 10%. Remaining tariffs were unchanged. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the deal would save jobs in the car and steel industries. (This story has been refiled to fix a typo in paragraph 12)",

Finland's Stubb was speaking after holding two conversations in the last 24 hours with Zelenskiy and one with Trump, as fighting continued on the ground. \"I feel carefully optimistic that at this particular moment in time, we're moving in the right direction, both militarily on the ground, as Zelenskiy has pointed out, and also in terms of the ceasefire and the peace process,\" Stubb told a press conference with his Norwegian counterpart and after a meeting of Northern European nations' leaders in Oslo. \"We can't give a timetable now, but in an ideal world a Ukraine ceasefire would be declared over the weekend.\" Stubb and Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere initiated the phone call with Trump late on Thursday, after speaking with Ukraine's Zelenskiy earlier in the day.

    "title": "India-Pakistan conflict offers rich intelligence opportunity for China",
    "content": "HONG KONG, May 9 (Reuters) - The conflict between India and Pakistanover Kashmiroffers a potentially rich intelligence harvest for China in its own rivalry with India as it gleansdata from its fighter jetsand other weapons used in action by Pakistan. Security analysts and diplomats say China's military modernisation has reached a point where it has the ability to deeply scrutinise Indian actions in real time from its border installations and Indian Ocean fleets as well as from space. \"From an intelligence perspective, this is a rare target of opportunity right on China's borders involving a key potential adversary,\" said Singapore-based security analyst Alexander Neill. Two U.S. officials said a Chinese-made J-10 Pakistani jet fightershot downat least two Indian military planes - one of them a French-made Rafale fighter. India has not acknowledged the loss of any of its planes while Pakistan's defence and foreign ministers have confirmed the use of J-10 aircraft but not commented on which missiles or other weapons were used. The aerial clash is arare opportunityfor militaries around the world to study the performance of pilots, fighter jets and air-to-air missiles in active combat, and use that knowledge to prepare their own air forces for battle. Competing regional giants and nuclear powers, India and China are widely seen as long-term strategic rivals, sharing a 3,800 (2,400 mile) Himalayan border that has been disputed since the 1950s and sparked a brief war in 1962. The most recent standoff - that started in 2020 - thawed in October as the two sides struck a patrolling agreement. Security analysts say both sides have taken steps to strengthen their military facilities and capabilities along the border, but it is also from above that China packs an intelligence gathering punch. The London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) notes that China now fields 267 satellites - including 115 devoted to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and a further 81 that monitor military electronic and signals information. It is a network that dwarfs its regional rivals, including India, and is second only to the U.S.. \"Both in terms of space and missile tracking capabilities, China is much better off now in terms of being able to monitor things as they happen,\" said Neill, who is an adjunct fellow at Hawaii's Pacific Forum think-tank. China's defence ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters' questions about the deployment of its military satellites and other questions about its intelligence gathering. Pakistan's military media wing and information minister did not immediately respond to a request for comment on any information sharing with China. Pakistan has previously said it has an \"all-weather strategic, cooperative partnership\" with China. India has not commented on the issue, but its top diplomat in Britain, High Commissioner Vikram Doraiswami, told Sky News on Thursday that China's relationship with Pakistan was not a concern for India. \"China requires a relationship with all of its neighbours, that includes us,\" he said. Chinese military intelligence teams would be eager to garner information on any Indian use of air defences and launches of cruise and ballistic missiles - not just in terms of flight paths and accuracy but command and control information, analysts and diplomats say. Any deployment of India's BrahMos supersonic cruise missile - a weapon it developed jointly with Russia - would be of particular interest, some analysts say, given they do not believe it has been used in combat. China has also beefed up its intelligence gathering at sea. It has been increasingly active in the Indian Ocean in recent years, with China deploying space tracking ships as well as oceanographic research and fishing vessels on extended deployments, open source intelligence trackers say. Regional diplomats say that while the Chinese navy has been relatively cautious about extensive warship deployments into the Indian Ocean, still lacking a broad network of bases, it actively seeks intelligence with these other vessels. Over the last week, some trackers noted unusually large fleets of Chinese fishing vessels moving apparently in unison to within 120 nautical miles of Indian naval drills in the Arabian Sea as tensions rose with Pakistan. Pentagon reports on China's military modernisation and analysts note that China's fishing fleets routinely perform a coordinated militia function that plays an important intelligence gathering role. \"These vessels may double up as listening posts, tracking development rhythms and response patterns, feeding early warning, naval intel to their sponsors,\" wrote open source tracker Damien Symon in an X post that highlighted the deployment of 224 Chinese vessels near Indian naval exercises on May 1. Chinese officials do not usually acknowledge the existence of fishing militia or intelligence work carried out by other nominally-civilian vessels. Given its deep and broad strategic relationship with Pakistan, Beijing can also be expected to fully exploit its network of envoys and military teams there for key nuggets. \"The presence of Chinese military advisers and other personnel in Pakistan is well-known given how Pakistan's Ministry of Defence has been importing some of its most advanced military hardware from China, so we can be certain the PLA would be able to access relevant data,\" said James Char, a Chinese security scholar at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.",

    "content": "ISLAMABAD/WASHINGTON, May 8 (Reuters) - A top Chinese-made Pakistani fighter plane shot down at least two Indian military aircraft on Wednesday, two U.S. officials told Reuters, marking a major milestone for Beijing's advanced fighter jet. An Indian Air Force spokesperson said he had no comment when asked about the Reuters report. The performance of a leading Chinese fighter jet against a Western rival is being closely watched in Washington for insights into how Beijing might fare in any showdown over Taiwan or the wider Indo-Pacific. One U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was high confidence that Pakistan had used the Chinese-made J-10 aircraft to launch air-to-air missiles against Indian fighter jets - bringing down at least two. Another official said at least one Indian jet that was shot down was a French-made Rafale fighter aircraft.

While Reutersreported on Wednesdaythat three Indian planes went down, citing local government officials in India, this marks the first Western confirmation that Pakistan's Chinese-made jets were used in the shootdowns. Pakistan’s Defense minister, Khawaja Muhammad Asif, told Reuters on Thursday that the J-10 was used to shoot down three French-made Rafale planes, which were newly acquired by India. Altogether, Pakistan says it downed five Indian planes in air-to-air combat. The Rafale and the model of the J-10 used by Pakistan are both considered generation 4.5 fighter jets, placing them at the leading edge of combat aircraft. Western analysts and defense industry sources said the live use of some of the advanced weapons that could be deployed in future major power conflicts would be scrutinized in minute detail, but emphasized it was too early to draw firm conclusions. \"Air warfare communities in China, the U.S. and a number of European countries will be extremely interested to try and get as much ground truth as they can on tactics, techniques, procedures, what kit was used, what worked and what didn't,\" said Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

But the analysts and sources said crucial details were unclear including whether Meteors were carried or how they may have been deployed. \"At the moment it's not possible to judge anything.

Blasts rang out across the city of Jammu in Indian Kashmir late on Thursday during what Indian military sources said they suspected was a Pakistani drone attack across the region on the second day of clashes between the neighbors. Pakistan said earlier on Thursday it shot down 25 drones from India overnight, while India said its air defenses had stopped Pakistani drone and missile attacks on military targets.",

    "content": "NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - The sex-trafficking trial ofSean \"Diddy\" Combs, which kicks off on Monday, marks the highest-profile case so far for a nascent group in the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's office focusing on criminal prosecution of civil rights violations. Since its launch in 2022 by then-Manhattan U.S. AttorneyDamian Williams, the unit has brought 21 criminal cases with allegations including antisemitic hate crimes, excessive use of force by law enforcement, sexual abuse of a minor, and environmental negligence by a construction contractor. The nine-lawyer group, called the Civil Rights Unit in the Criminal Division, is separate from a longstanding Civil Rights Unit in the Civil Division. That unit generally brings civil lawsuits against companies and local government entities, including a lawsuit against New York City to try to reduce violence in jails. The new criminal division unit has a solid record. It has secured 15 guilty pleas and one trial conviction, with two defendants acquitted at trial, according to a Reuters review of press releases and court records. Ten defendants charged by the unit, including Combs, have cases pending. The trial of Combs, who is known forelevating hip-hop in American culture, will bring more international attention to the unit's work than previous cases. Combs, 55, pleaded not guilty last September to forcing women to participate in sexual performances. The jury is expected to be seated on Monday. Three months after Combs was charged, Williams announced sex-trafficking charges against Oren Alexander and Tal Alexander, the cofounders of aluxury U.S. real estate brokerage, and their brother Alon Alexander. All three have pleaded not guilty. \"There has been additional resources and time and attention\" devoted to sex trafficking, Williams told reporters at the time. Williams, appointed by former Democratic President Joe Biden, has said he formed the unit to centralize responsibility for sex-trafficking cases, which were previously spread across different units, and to address a spike in hate crimes. Antisemitic threats and violence have been the subject of six of the unit's cases. On Wednesday, the unit charged Tarek Bazrouk, 20, with hate crimes for allegedlyassaulting Jewish individuals, including two Columbia University students, during protests over thewar in Gaza. Bazrouk has pleaded not guilty. Both that indictment and additional criminal charges against the Alexander brothers unveiled on Thursday were approved by Jay Clayton, Republican PresidentDonald Trump's pick to lead the U.S. Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York. \"I was immediately impressed by the speed and impact of the Civil Rights Unit’s work,\" Clayton, who took office on April 22, told Reuters in a statement. \"I continue to be heartened by the skill and determination of this group of talented prosecutors.\" While the unit handles a broad range of cases, many involve alleged abuse of power, whether by a wealthy individual like Combs or an armed security guard like Jimmy Solano-Arias, who was sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to a charge stemming from his sexual abuse of an asylum-seeker at the federal building where he worked. \"The skill sets you need to handle those types of cases are similar,\" said Sarah Krissoff, a former federal prosecutor in Manhattan and current partner at law firm Cozen O'Connor. The prosecutors on Combs' case include Maurene Comey, who secured the conviction of British socialiteGhislaine Maxwellon sex-trafficking charges at trial, and Mitzi Steiner, who charged Solano-Arias. Victims of sexual violence can be hesitant to come forward, and prosecutors who specialize in such cases may be more effective, said Rachel Maimin, a former federal prosecutor in Manhattan. \"It's not the same as working with victims of other violent crimes,\" said Maimin, a partner at law firm Lowenstein Sandler.",

    "content": "LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has doubled down on his claim that his side were the best in the Champions League this season, despite losing to Paris St Germain in the semi-finals, but recognised on Friday they had taken a step back domestically. Speaking ahead of second-placed Arsenal's trip to Premier League champions Liverpool on Sunday, the Spaniard stood by his midweek assertion that he had not seen a better team in Europe's top club competition. \"100%,\" Arteta told reporters on Friday. \"I've watched it back, seen all the stats. We had the best stats and best goal difference in the semi-final so it is very clear. \"But it's not about the winning probability or what you've merited, it's actually making it happen and making it count. \"When you look at the important stats that normally give you the best platform to win football matches, it's crystal clear who was better.\" Arteta said Arsenal had stepped up in the Champions League and Wednesday's second legsemi-final defeatwas \"one of the saddest, but one of the proudest moments that I have had as an Arsenal manager for many obvious reasons.\" The Gunners are 15 points behind Liverpool and only three clear of third-placed Manchester City and four ahead of Newcastle United and Chelsea in the Premier league. Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa are also still battling for top-five placings with three matches remaining. \"In the Premier League we've done a step backwards. With the points that we have created, it's clear that we haven't done as good as last season, that's obvious,\" said Arteta, who felt Arsenal could have won two titles in different circumstances. They have registered more than 80 points in each of the two seasons before this one, a tally greater than some championship-winning sides have managed in the Premier League era. They are currently on 67 to Liverpool's 82. Arteta said Liverpool fully deserved a guard of honour from Arsenal's players at Anfield and it would serve as further motivation for the next campaign. \"If somebody's better, you have to approve and accept and try to reach that level,\" he said. The Spaniard said Arsenal intended to finish on a high and \"make sure that we make ourselves proud at least to compete and end in the manner that we deserve.\"",

    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - Ukraine will host a meeting of leaders of the so-called \"coalition of the willing\" on Saturday, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said. Established earlier this year and led by France and Britain, the coalition reflects concern among Europeans that the U.S. no longer represents a bulwark of support for Ukraine's three-year-old battle against a full-blownRussian invasion. \"We need this coalition, and it should be strong enough to guarantee security in line with our common vision,\" Zelenskiy said in a video address published by his office in Kyiv. Progress on what role Europe might play in providing post-war security guarantees is proving difficult with the prospect of a ceasefire distant and much dependent on how Russia responds and to what extent the U.S. would support its allies. Ukraine is seeking clear security guarantees from allies to safeguard it against any future Russian military action. The coalition has been mulling the possibility of a limited foreign contingent deployment to Ukraine as part of possible guarantees. Zelenskiy said on Thursday he had told U.S. President Donald Trump in a telephone call that a30-day ceasefirewas a \"real indicator\" of progress towards peace with Russia, and Kyiv was ready to implement it immediately. A 30-day ceasefire was initially proposed by Trump in March and Ukraine agreed, while Russia said such a measure could only take effect once reliable measures of monitoring and upholding it were put in place. Zelenskiy did not specify which of the leaders was going to come to Kyiv for the coalition meeting, but earlier this week Germany's new chancellor Friedrich Merz said he intended to visit Ukraine in the near future. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday that France would take part in a meeting in Ukraine on Saturday.

    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson(JNJ.N), opens new tabsaid on Friday its experimental psoriasis drug met the main goal of a late-stage study, as the once-daily pill helped patients achieve clear or almost clear skin. The drugmaker has been working on more convenient treatment options as its injectable psoriasis drug Stelara, which gained over $10 billion in sales last year, faces stiff competition from cheaper rivals. J&J said last month it expects the drug, icotrokinra, to generate sales of $700 million in 2028.

Icotrokinra helped 66% of patients with scalp psoriasis and 77% of those with genital psoriasis achieve significantly clear skin compared to 11% and 21% success rate in patients on placebo, respectively, J&J said. The drug was administered to patients 12 years and older with at least moderate plaque psoriasis affecting \"high-impact\" areas, including the scalp and genitals, for 16 weeks. Plaque psoriasis, an immune-mediated condition characterized by thick, scaly patches or plaques, is the most common type of psoriasis. Psoriasis is estimated to affect more than 7.5 million adults in the United States.

    "content": "MURIDKE, Pakistan, May 7 (Reuters) - (This May 7 story has been corrected to change the attribution to Jaish-e-Mohammed statement, not the military, in paragraph 3) Video footage from the early hours of Wednesday shows a bright flash from the residential Islamic seminary outside Bahawalpur in central Pakistan as Indiaattacked its neighbourin response to the killing of Indian tourists in Kashmir. The seminary was emptied of its students in recent days as speculation grew that it would be targeted by India, but the family of Masood Azhar, founder of the Jaish-e-Mohammed Islamist militant group, was still there, according to the group. Ten of Azhar's relatives were among 13 people killed in the strike, including women and children, the group said in a statement. Thousands of people turned out for their funerals at a sports stadium later in the day, shouting \"Allah Akbar\", or God is Great, and other religious chants. \"(Indian Prime Minister Narendra) Modi's brutality has broken all norms,\" the group said in a statement. \"The grief and shock are indescribable\". It said that five of those killed were children and the others included Azhar's sister and her husband. It did not respond to a request for comment on why the family was still at the site. Azhar, who has not been seen for years, and his brother, Abdul Rauf Asghar, deputy head of the group, did not appear to have attended the funeral prayers. The road to the site was cordoned off after the strike. Further north, around half an hour after midnight, four Indian missiles hit a sprawling complex in Muridke over six minutes, a local government official said. The attack demolished a mosque and adjacent administration building and buried three people in the rubble. A sign outside describes the site as a government health and educational complex, but India says it is associated with the militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Delhi and Washington blame LeT for the 2008 attack on the Indian city of Mumbai that killed more than 160 people. LeT, which has denied responsibility for that attack, is banned. The attack left other buildings in the complex untouched. A local official said that normally there were up to 3,500 staff and students at the site, but almost everyone had been evacuated in recent days as they feared it would become a target. Hafiz Saeed, leader of LeT and its successor organizations, is in a Pakistani jail since being convicted in 2020, onterror financing charges. He says his network, which spans 300 seminaries and schools, hospitals, a publishing house and ambulance services, has no ties to militant groups. Delhi said it had conducted pinpoint strikes on the two headquarters of itsmilitant adversaries, part of what it said were nine \"terrorist camps\" targeted. \"Over the last three decades Pakistan has systematically built terror infrastructure,\" it said in a briefing on the attacks. Pakistan said India had hit six sites, killing 26 people and wounding 46, all \"innocent civilians\". Officials and experts said India's attack on its neighbour, its most significant in decades, fulfilled a long-cherished goal, but Islamabad warned that it would hit back. The conflict between India and Pakistan has been confined in recent decades mostly to the disputed mountainous region of Kashmir. But the air strikes in the towns of Bahawalpur and Muridke were seen in Islamabad as a major escalation. India said seven of its targets were used by Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, both Islamist groups designated \"terrorist\" organisations by the U.N. Security Council. India launched the attacks in response to the killing of 26 people, mostly tourists in Indian Kashmir last month. Jaish says that it carries out educational and charity work in Pakistan and its militant activities are only in India. Delhi says that it runs training camps in Pakistan, as well as indoctrination schools, and that it launches militants into India. For decades Hindu-majority India has accused Pakistan of supporting Islamist militants in attacks on Indian interests, especially in Kashmir. Pakistan denies such support and in turn accuses India of supporting separatist rebels in Pakistan, which New Delhi denies.",

    "content": "LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Britain's steel sector on Friday urged clarity on when U.S. tariffs will be scrapped under a landmark first deal to remove President Donald Trump's levies on the sector. Britain on Thursday hailed a deal withthe U.S., which it said would reduce steel levies to 0% from 25% so that British producers could keep exporting to the United States. However, details released late on Thursday showed the two sides must still formalise the security requirements and the quotas that the steel sector must abide by, leaving sector representatives unclear as to when levies will go. \"It's certainly not a formality; I mean there's clearly a lot that hasn't been fully determined and defined in the agreement as of yet,\" said Chrysa Glystra, Director, Trade and Economic Policy at industry body UK Steel. Glystra added that firms did not know the supply chain conditions they would have to fulfil to take advantage of the tariffs. \"We don't really have a sense of when this will take effect and what the timescales will be.\" Britain's steel sector contributed 1.7 billion to the UK economy in 2024, 0.1% of total output, and the future of the industry has been in some doubt. The government last month intervened to keep theblast furnaces burningat the UK's last maker of virgin steel, seizing operational control from its Chinese owners. Details of the U.S. deal released by the British government showed that access to the zero tariff was contingent on a pledge by Britain to \"work to promptly meet U.S. requirements on the security of the supply chains of steel and aluminium products intended for export to the United States and on the nature of ownership of relevant production facilities.\" \"Understanding the United Kingdom will meet these requirements, the United States will promptly construct a quota,\" the agreement's General Terms said. The Office of the United States Trade Representative said that the U.S. and UK \"will negotiate an alternative arrangement\" on the steel tariff. Britain's trade ministry declined to give a timeframe for when the steel deal would be formalised. UK Steel's Glystra said there was ongoing engagement with the British government that had been constructive. \"The fact that we now have a foundation of something which is better than what we had before is positive,\" she said. \"It's obviously not as positive as it would be if we were told that as of today, there were zero tariffs on steel, because that would be preferable.\"",

After ending costly subsidies and twice devaluing the naira currency in his first year in office, Tinubu has shifted his focus to reforming the tax system to boost revenue and efficiency. Critics say the measures, which include an increase in value-added tax to 12.5% next year from 7.5%, will worseneconomic hardshipin Africa's most populous country of more than 200 million. Parliament's passage of the four bills, despite opposition from lawmakers and governors within Tinubu's party, is a victory for his administration's efforts to shore up government revenue and overhaul the country's fiscal framework. Nigeria has one of the world's lowest tax-to-GDP ratios, at 10.8%, forcing the government to rely on borrowing to fund the budget. Sani Musa, who chaired the Senate committee that reviewed the bills, said their passage triggered an amendment to Nigeria's oil law. The changes transfer \"fiscal administration duties, such as royalty and petroleum profit tax collection, to the newly proposed Nigeria Revenue Service\", he said on Friday. Musa clarified that other provisions in the oil law remain unchanged. Nigeria's lower House of Representativespassedthe tax bills in March. Now, the Senate's passage requires both chambers to reconcile their versions before sending the final bills to Tinubu for his assent.",

    "content": "LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Two men were found guilty on Friday of cutting down Britain's 'Sycamore Gap' tree two years ago, felling the much-loved landmark whose dramatic silhouette had featured in a Hollywood movie in what prosecutors described as a \"moronic mission\". The sycamore, estimated to be almost 200 years old, stood at the centre of a dramatic dip in the landscape alongside the historic Hadrian's Wall in northern England, making it a popular spot for photographers, hikers and even marriage proposals. Such was its fame that it featured in the 1991 film \"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\" and its felling in September 2023 provoked widespread grief and anger. Prosecutor Richard Wrighttold jurorsat Newcastle Crown Court last month that Daniel Graham, 39, and Adam Carruthers, 32, were responsible for the \"mindless vandalism\", expertly and deliberately cutting it down with a chainsaw. The felling also caused damage to part of Hadrian's Wall, built by the Romans almost 2,000 years ago and now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Graham and Carruthers, who travelled to the site in the Northumberland National Park from their homes in the Carlisle area, about 25 miles away, had denied any involvement. But they were convicted of two counts of criminal damage. The men will be sentenced on July 15. \"For over a century, Sycamore Gap has been an iconic natural landmark in the north east of England, bringing immeasurable joy to those visiting the area,\" Chief Crown Prosecutor Gale Gilchrist said. \"In just under three minutes, Graham and Carruthers ended its historic legacy in a deliberate and mindless act of destruction.\" During the trial, the jury was shown a video of their \"moronic mission\", filmed on Graham's mobile phone, which showed grainy footage of what appeared to be the iconic tree being cut down. The prosecution said the men had taken a wedge of the tree as a trophy and messages they sent to each other afterwards showed they had been \"revelling\" in the worldwide reaction to the incident. No explanation has been given for their actions. The National Trust, a heritage conservation charity which looks after the site, said last August there were signs of life at the base of thetree, giving hope it might live on.",

    "content": "BERLIN, May 9 (Reuters) - German legislators are demanding an explanation from a senior Social Democrat on the parliamentary committee that scrutinises the work of the intelligence services after he held undisclosed talks with close associates of Russia's president. Ralf Stegner, a member of the Bundestag's Parliamentary Control Committee, was among politicians from the SPD and Chancellor Friedrich Merz's conservatives who took part in the April meeting in Baku. Among those they met on April 13 in the Azerbaijan capital was former Russian Prime Minister Viktor Subkov, head of Gazprom's supervisory board, and Valery Fadeyev, EU-sanctioned chair of Russia's human rights council. On both sides, the participants were former members of the Petersburger Dialogue, a forum founded in 2001 by Russian President Vladimir Putin and then-Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. The forum was officially disbanded in 2021 after Russia's crackdown on several participating civil society organisations. Four German participants - Stegner, Ronald Pofalla - who once led former Chancellor Angela Merkel's office - and two former regional ministers - confirmed in a statement to Reuters that they had been at a \"private\" event in Baku. \"Talking even in difficult times of growing tension is a fundamental principle of good foreign policy,\" they wrote, adding that the \"confidential\" meeting was not secret, and none of them had a public mandate to be there or had been paid for their presence. The meeting, first reported by ARD public television and newspaper Die Zeit, took place at a time when Russia's ties with the EU are in a deep freeze over its invasion of Ukraine. The timing raised questions over the apparent willingness of some politicians to seek rapprochement even as Moscow wages war on a German ally. In Stegner's case, critics also raised security concerns: Members of the parliamentary control committee have privileged, confidential access to the work of Germany's foreign and domestic security services, both of them heavily involved in gathering intelligence relating to Russia and the war. \"This is a quite impossible and irritating development that must immediately be cleared up,\" Konstantin von Notz, the Green chair of the committee, told Der Spiegel. Roderich Kiesewetter, a conservative member of the committee, said Stegner should explain himself, while liberal European legislator Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann said Stegner should not be nominated for a new term on the committee. \"People in such a key role have to be above all suspicion,\" she told Funke newspapers. \"That is not the case for him.\"",

The company snagged a 13-year contractvalued at $1.56 billionfrom U.S.-based travel technology provider Sabre Corp(SABR.O), opens new tabin the previous quarter. That came at a time when larger rivals struggled to secure mega deals as macroeconomic uncertainties and tariff risks weighed on the Indian IT sector. Coforge's revenue for the last fiscal year stood at $1.45 billion. \"If all we've done in FY27 is $2 billion, then I'll be really disappointed,\" CEO Singh said in an interview on Tuesday. \"Our next 12-month signed order book is 47.7% higher than where it was at the same time last year,\" he said. Despite the high level of uncertainty, Singh is hopeful that tech spending cannot go down in areas where it is \"structural in nature\". Singh said Coforge's demand outlook in the current fiscal year is strong, as all its verticals and geographies are growing. The company gets nearly 30% of its revenue from banking and financial services, 19% from insurance and 18% from travel, transportation and hospitality. The IT firm's revenue grew 33.8% in the fiscal year ending March, and it is relying on steady organic growth this year. \"I don't see organic growth slowing in any shape or manner in FY26,\" Singh said. Coforge's organic revenue growth stood at about 16.4% last fiscal year, according to Kotak Institutional Equities. Nomura said it expects the company's organic revenue growth to \"accelerate\" this fiscal year. Larger peer Infosys(INFY.NS), opens new tabexpects a revenue growth of zero to 3% this fiscal year while HCLTech(HCLT.NS), opens new tabforesees a 2% to 5% rise. Singh is bullish on operating margins going up \"materially\" as Coforge focuses on larger deals. \"We will take whatever comes our way, but we have a strong preference for larger deals because they help with visibility, they help with resilience of revenue, and they also help longer term in margin expansion.\"",

Overall, booking trends remain stable, given Air Canada's diverse network and exposure to international destinations, where demand remains strong. Results were solid in Mexico and the Caribbean as Canadians look for alternative destinations, the carrier said. North American airlines have been trimming flight schedules amid weakening U.S. domestic bookings, scrapping financial forecasts and tightening cost controls — including on rising labor expenses — to safeguard margins. Air Canada on Thursday reported an adjusted quarterly loss per share of C$0.45, ahead of analysts' average estimate of a loss of C$0.54, according to data compiled by LSEG. The carrier also said it would purchase and cancel up to C$500 million in shares by the end of next month.

    "content": "BRUSSELS, May 9 (Reuters) - German Chancellor Friedrich Merz did not rule out common European Union borrowing for defence during a trip to Brussels on Friday, but said it must be for exceptional circumstances and voiced concern about rising global debt. Visiting Brussels for the first time as chancellor, Merz also said he was now more optimistic about the future of NATO than in February, when hequestionedwhether the alliance that has been the bedrock of European security would still exist in its current form when its leaders meet in June. He said U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, which has warned European allies it will not protect them if they do not spend enough on defence, had now recognised that Europeans were taking more responsibility for their own security. \"America is indispensable for the security of Europe - today and for a long time to come,\" Merz told reporters at NATO headquarters. \"I am very thankful today that I can come to a more optimistic assessment of the future of NATO.\" Russia'swar in Ukraineand its hostility towards other European countries, coupled with fears that the U.S. might not come to the aid of NATO allies, have prompted many European leaders to ramp up defence spending and vow to do even more. That has led many European governments to back common EU borrowing to fund a defence spending splurge. But fiscally cautious Germany, the EU's largest economy, has traditionally rejected common borrowing, with the exception of during the COVID pandemic when it was used to fund recovery projects. Merz, who took office on Tuesday, told a joint press conference with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen that he did not want to preempt conversations in his government and the EU over different financing options. When asked about common debt, he said the guiding principle must remain that the EU should take on debt only in exceptional circumstances, without saying whether he thought the current situation qualified as such. \"We had the exceptional situation of the coronavirus pandemic, and now we face a new major challenge: the establishment - or re-establishment - of the European Union’s defence capability,\" Merz said. \"We are looking for ways to finance this.\" Before taking office, he pushed a historic fiscal package through parliament that would allow his government to sharply increase national defence spending, suggesting he would take a more assertive stance on defence than his predecessor. Merz is also a conservative who has long advocated fiscal rectitude. He said on Friday he was \"worried about the constantly rising national debt around the world - not just in Europe, but also, for example, in the United States\". \"And I do wonder how long it will be possible not only to refinance the debt itself but also to finance the interest payments. We cannot keep taking on debt indefinitely,\" he said. German debt is just above 60% of GDP - half of the level of the U.S. and two thirds the euro zone average.",

Juve missed a chance to strengthen their grip on fourth place after being held to a1-1 draw at Bolognaon Sunday and they sit level on 63 points with fifth-placed AS Roma and Lazio in sixth with three games remaining.

You have to prepare well.\" Juve, who suffered a first league defeat at the end of January, have lost three and drawn two of their last eight games. \"I saw awareness and confidence (this week), and a great desire to do well,\" Tudor said. \"We know the importance of this match (Lazio) and we prepared ourselves as best we could.\" Juventus welcome back striker Dusan Vlahovic, their top scorer this season with nine league goals, who returned to group training on Thursday after being sidelined with a thigh injury since late April. \"Dusan is fine. He was all week with us,\" Tudor said. \"(Federico Gatti and Teun Koopmeiners), meanwhile, will not be there, although Gatti played a little bit with us and will be on the bench.\" Former defender Tudor, who briefly coached Lazio last year after Maurizio Sarri's resignation and left them seventh in the standings, was optimistic about facing his former side. \"Last year we did a great job and went to the Europa League,\" Tudor recalled. \"Then I made a calm decision (to leave) and I (still) love everyone.

    "content": "OTTAWA, May 9 (Reuters) - Canada's unemployment rate rose to 6.9% in April, the highest since November, asU.S. tariffsstarted to hit Canada's export-dependent economy in earnest, data showed on Friday. The high unemployment rate in Canada, where the number of jobless people is inching towards 1.6 million, was partly a result of U.S.President Donald Trump'stariffs on a raft of Canadian imports, Statistics Canada said, referring to the jobs shed in the manufacturing sector. Overall, the employment number was largely flat with minimal gains of net 7,400 jobs in April, it said. This was in contrast to a loss of 32,600 jobs the prior month. Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted employment to increase by 2,500 people and the unemployment rate to increase to 6.8%. The 6.9% figure matched November unemployment, which wasan eight-year highoutside of the pandemic era. Trump's tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum in March and automobiles in April, along with import duties on a broad range of products with various reductions and exemptions have impacted businesses and households. The Bank of Canada has warned that growth would take a major hit in coming months as exports fall, prices increase, hiring reduces and layoffs accelerate. It has vowed toact decisivelyif the economy needs urgent support. \"Overall, we are seeing a job market that was weak heading into the trade war, now looking like it could soon buckle. Today's report supports the case for a Bank of Canada cut in June,\" said Ali Jaffery, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets. Currency swap market bets show odds of a 25 basis point rate cut in June at over 55% roughly. The Canadian dollar was trading up 0.1% to 1.3909 U.S. dollar, or 71.90 U.S. cents. Yields on two-year government bonds fell 3.3 basis points to 2.586% after the labor force data was released. The number of unemployed people, or those looking for work or on temporary layoff, increased by 39,000 or 2.6% in April, and was up by 189,000 or 13.9% on a year-over-year basis. \"People who were unemployed continued to face more difficulties finding work in April than a year earlier,\" Statscan said, adding that among those who were unemployed in March, 61% remained unemployed in April which was almost four percentage points higher than the same period last year. The tariffs and the uncertainty around them especially hit the manufacturing sector which shed 31,000 jobs in the month, Statscan said, adding retail and wholesale trade also saw a drop in the number of employed people. The employment rate, or the proportion of the working age population that is employed, was at 60.8% in April, following a decline of 0.2 percentage points in March. This was a six-month low, the statistics agency said. The employment rate had been depressed for most of 2023 and 2024 as population growth outpaced employment gains. However, since February population growth has not been very high but employment gains have slowed. Employment in the public sector increased by 23,000 or up 0.5% in April, following three consecutive months of little change, especially due to increased temporary hiring for the federal election. The average hourly wage growth of permanent employees, a metric closely watched by the Canadian central bank to gauge inflationary trends, was at 3.5% in April, same as March.",

Zambia's health ministry responded in a statement acknowledging the U.S. ambassador's concerns and said recurrent theft of medicines was a \"persistent challenge\" dating back to before 2021. After he was alerted to the issue Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema commissioned an independent forensic audit of the entire medicines supply chain, the ministry said. A number of officials found to have been involved had been removed from office or suspended, while others were arrested and are set to appear in court. \"We want to assure the public that Zambia currently maintains sufficient stocks of essential medicines, including antiretroviral, antimalarial, and other critical drugs, with no immediate risk of shortages,\" Zambia's health ministry said. Gonzales said he had recommended to Washington that the U.S. continue to procure and deliver lifesaving medicines and medical supplies to Zambia until January 2026 to provide time for the government to develop a transition plan. After January, the U.S. will still offer technical and logistics assistance to support humanitarian activities and prevent drug resistance and disease transmission, he said.",

I met her yesterday and once before. She's a very outstanding person, a great academic, actually. So, I think she'll be great.\" Kennedy said Means, a longtime ally and prominent voice in his \"Make America Healthy Again\" movement, was the perfect choice for surgeon general because she had bucked the medical system. \"Casey has excelled in every endeavor she has undertaken. She was President of her Stanford undergrad class, was a standout at Stanford Medical School, and was a top performer in surgical residency,\" Kennedy wrote on X. \"She had the courage to leave traditional medicine because she realized her patients weren't getting better.\" He blamed \"badly entrenched interests--including Big Food and its industry-funded social media gurus\" for the backlash. Means, who could not be reached for comment Thursday night, reposted Kennedy's comments. Kennedy went on to defend Means in a Fox News interview on Thursday night and said the MAHA commission report Trump tasked him with would come next week. Trump signed an executive order to establish a commission to \"Make America Healthy Again,\" during Kennedy's swearing in ceremony on February 13 and tasked it with investigating chronic illness and delivering an action plan to fight childhood diseases, starting with a report due within 100 days.",

    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - Bayer Leverkusen coach Xabi Alonso will leave his role at the end of the season, with the Spaniard saying on Friday the time was right after a fruitful three-year spell, as media reports link him to the Real Madrid job for next term. Alonso took charge of Leverkusen in October 2022 and guided them to the double last season as they lifted their first Bundesliga title, without losing a game, while they also won the German Cup and reached the Europa League final. Alonso had a contract until 2026 but the club said they had granted his wish to terminate his deal at the end of the season. \"We can let you know that this week the club and I, we have agreed that these two games are going to be my last two games as Bayer Leverkusen coach,\" Alonso told reporters. Leverkusen, who will finish the season as runners-up to Bayern Munich, host Borussia Dortmund on Sunday in what will be Alonso's final home game before ending the Bundesliga campaign at Mainz 05 on May 17. \"We've been talking during this week and now it's the right moment to announce it,\" Alonso added of his departure. \"Now that we have clarity it's the right moment to say that for sure it's a moment with mixed emotions, that it's the moment to announce it and to know it.\" Vincent Kompany's BayernMunich reclaimed the Bundesliga titlefrom Leverkusen with two games left to play, with Alonso's side currently eight points adrift of the Bavarians. Looking back at his time with Leverkusen, Alonso said the first season was the most difficult campaign as he came in with the club lying in the relegation zone before he propelled the side to a top-six finish to qualify for the Europa League. \"The second season was a historic season, it was a dream season with great nights, great games and we made history,\" he added. \"This season has been the most challenging one. When we had to fulfil expectations, when we were playing in the Champions League, where we were playing to try to give our best and when we don't make a final we are disappointed.\" Leverkusen lost 5-0 on aggregate to Bayern in the Champions League last 16 and 2-1 to Arminia Bielefeld in the German Cup. \"There has been development in the club, in the players and in myself. I have learned so many things and I have improved as a coach, as someone that needs to have more resources for myself, for the future.\" Alonso also said he was proud of what he is leaving behind - a squad capable of fighting for titles. Asked about what he will do next, Alonso said: \"It's not the moment to talk too much about the future because now that we know, we want to have a proper farewell on Sunday here for some players, for myself.\" Alonso has been widely tipped to return to Real Madrid, the club where he won four major trophies as a player, including the 10th Champions League crown that the Spanish giants had waited 12 years to win.

Ancelotti has been linked with the Brazil job and has not confirmed if he will take charge of Real at the Club World Cup in the United States next month, saying that he wouldtalk about his future on May 25- the final day of the LaLiga season. When Alonso was asked if he held a valid visa to travel to the U.S., the Spaniard smiled and said: \"No idea!\"",

    "title": "Former US Supreme Court Justice Souter dies",
    "content": "WASHINGTON, May 9 (Reuters) - Bookish and reclusive jurist David Souter, who joined the U.S. Supreme Court as a supposed conservative \"stealth nominee\" but instead emerged as a liberal justice who backed abortion rights and dissented in the 2000 ruling that gave the presidency to Republican George W. Bush, died on Thursday at age 85. Souter, who served 19 years on the court before retiring in 2009, died peacefully at his home in New Hampshire, the court said in a statement on Friday. \"Justice David Souter served our Court with great distinction for nearly twenty years. He brought uncommon wisdom and kindness to a lifetime of public service,\" Chief Justice John Roberts said in the statement. \"He will be greatly missed.\" When liberal stalwart William Brennan suddenly retired from the nation's top judicial body in 1990, Republican President George H.W. Bush chose Souter, then an obscure federal judge from New Hampshire with almost nothing known about his views on major issues. Bush, in selecting Souter, said he was familiar with his nominee's \"general views\" but did not apply \"the litmus test approach\" on abortion or other issues. White House officials at the time assured conservative Republicans that Souter would be a \"home run\" when it came to his legal views. During his Senate confirmation hearings, the Harvard Law School graduate who had served as New Hampshire's attorney general and a state court judge was dubbed the \"stealth nominee,\" with U.S. liberals fearful and abortion rights groups announcing their opposition. But Souter instead became a favorite of American liberals and a source of immense disappointment to conservatives. He supported abortion rights in a 1992 ruling that reaffirmed the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that had legalized the procedure nationwide, as well as backing affirmative action programs to help minorities overcome past discrimination and campaign-finance restrictions aimed at combating political corruption. Souter joined three liberal justices in dissent in the 5-4 Bush v. Gore ruling that ended a recount of ballots in Florida and effectively declared Republican George W. Bush, the son of the president who appointed him, the winner of the 2000 U.S. presidential election over Democrat Al Gore. \"There is no justification for denying the state the opportunity to try to count all disputed ballots now,\" Souter wrote in dissent. Souter announced his retirement at age 69, just months after George W. Bush left office - denying the son of the man who appointed him the chance to replace him and giving that opportunity to Barack Obama, a Democratic president. Obama lauded Souter when the justice retired as a \"fair-minded and independent judge.\" \"He came to the bench with no particular ideology. He never sought to promote a political agenda. And he consistently defied labels and rejected absolutes, focusing instead on just one task: reaching a just result in the case that was before him,\" Obama said. \"He approached judging as he approaches life, with a feverish work ethic and a good sense of humor, with integrity, equanimity and compassion - the hallmark of not just being a good judge, but of being a good person.\" It marked the first time a Democratic president got to appoint a justice in 15 years. Obama picked liberal Sonia Sotomayor, the first Hispanic person ever to become a justice. Souter also voted in cases to limit the use of the death penalty and in favor of the legal rights of the foreign terrorism suspects detained under George W. Bush at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey was perhaps the biggest disappointment to conservatives who had hoped the court would use the case to overturn Roe, which had recognized a woman's constitutional right to abortion. The 5-4 decision instead reaffirmed Roe and set a new standard barring regulations that imposed an \"undue burden\" on a woman's ability to obtain an abortion. Souter contributed to an opinion in the case emphasizing that the justices must follow precedent and resist outside political pressures. To overturn the abortion ruling would undermine the court's legitimacy, Souter warned. In 2022, the court, by that time with a 6-3 conservative majority, overturned Roe, a decision that led to numerous states imposing bans. During arguments before the court, Souter was known for a quick wit and intellectually challenging questions. Off the bench, the reclusive bachelor avoided the public eye, sticking to a small circle of friends from New Hampshire, watching a black-and-white television, and bringing his lunch of yogurt and an apple to the court each day. Souter, who lived in a small, sparsely furnished apartment not far from the court, usually drove himself to and from work in a Volkswagen. Souter treasured his privacy, disliked Washington life, avoided giving interviews to the news media and rarely gave public speeches or attended social functions in the U.S. capital. In one public speech a couple of months before he announced his retirement, Souter indicated he would rather spend his time reading books than being on the bench, saying he undergoes a \"sort of annual intellectual lobotomy\" as the court's annual term begins each October. \"I cram what I can into the summertime,\" Souter said of reading books. Souter appeared to cherish his anonymity, telling a congressional committee in 1996 that cameras would televise Supreme Court proceedings \"over my dead body.\" Souter told the story of meeting several people who mistook him for his colleague, Justice Stephen Breyer. When one of them asked what he most liked about the Supreme Court, he answered, \"Working with Justice Souter.\" David Hackett Souter was born September 17, 1939, in Weare, New Hampshire, where he was living at the time of his nomination as sole occupant of the family farmhouse. He was the only child of a bank officer father and homemaker mother. In 1990, the elder Bush first picked Souter to serve on the Boston-based 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals before promoting him to the Supreme Court just months later. Previously, Souter spent 12 years as a state superior and supreme court judge in New Hampshire. He was state attorney general for two years, succeeding his friend, the former U.S. senator, Warren Rudman. Souter graduated from Harvard University with honors and was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford before graduating from Harvard Law School.",

    "title": "US tariffs unlikely to have 'dramatic' UK impact, BoE chief economist says",
    "content": "LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - U.S. tariffs are not likely to have a \"dramatic\" effect on Britain's economy and the Bank of England should not neglect longer-term domestic pressures that might push up on inflation, BoE Chief Economist Huw Pill said on Friday. Pill, who voted against Thursday's quarter-point BoE rate cut, said he understood the BoE's \"gradual and careful\" approach to future rate cuts as requiring it to be agile and alert to changes in the economy that might require a different approach. \"The analysis in the baseline forecast does not suggest that there's a dramatic shift in the behaviour of the UK economy on the back of these trade announcements and trade uncertainties,\" Pill said in a presentation to businesses. On Thursday, the BoE said the impact of tariffs \"should not be overstated\" and was likely to lead to a 0.3% hit to the size of Britain's economy over three years and reduce inflation by 0.2 percentage points in two years' time. That was based on U.S. tariffs in effect on April 29, before a deal was announced on Thursday which should see a reduction in high tariffs on U.S. imports of British cars and steel, though a lower 10% tariff on most other goods will stay. Governor Andrew Bailey said earlier on Friday that this deal was\"good news\", relatively speaking, but still left tariffs higher than they had been previously. Pill said the central bank would not allow the uncertainty over tariffs to distract it from returning inflation - set to rise to 3.5% later this year - back to its 2% target. \"There are other forces - and maybe more long-lasting and underlying forces in the UK economy itself. Fergal (Shortall, BoE director of monetary analysis) emphasised the dynamics in pay and wages, and I think correctly so (which) certainly we should not neglect,\" he said. British wages are growing at an annual rate of around 6%, roughly double what most BoE policymakers think is a sustainable pace. On Thursday the BoE forecast private-sector wage growth would slow to 3.75% by the end of the year.",

    "title": "Explainer: Soccer-Argentine Apertura tournament explained",
    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - Argentina's football season shifts into high gear this weekend as the Apertura tournament kicks off its knockout phase, setting the stage for three weeks of drama. Here's everything you need to know as Argentina's top clubs chase glory. The Apertura or \"Opening\" tournament is half of Argentina's split-season format, which was reintroduced in 2025 after its last implementation in 2012. It runs from January to June and is followed by the Clausura or \"Closing\" tournament from July to December. The tournament reaches its climax after a 16-round group stage, where 30 clubs are split into two 15-team groups or zones playing 14 matches within their group and two inter-zonal clashes against the other. The top eight from each zone advance to the knockout stage, seeded by their regular-season results in a bracket designed to keep the nation's fiercest rivals apart until a possible final showdown. The round of 16, quarter-finals and semi-finals will be single-legged ties hosted by the higher-seeded team with matches level after 90 minutes proceeding straight to penalties. The final will be played on neutral ground at the Estadio Unico Madre de Ciudades in Santiago del Estero on June 1, with extra time before penalties if necessary. Despite occasional stumbles through the group stage, River Plate and Boca Juniors remain the dominant forces in Argentine football, accounting for seven of the last 10 league titles between them. With the big two on opposite sides of the bracket, hopes are high for a potential Superclasico final that would send the nation into collective delirium. River appear to be hitting their stride at the right time, having scored 11 goals in their last four matches, including a 4-1 thrashing of reigning champions Velez Sarsfield, who failed to qualify for the knockouts. Boca were on top form before a late stumble, including a Superclasico loss, saw them slip from top spot on goal difference. Beyond the Buenos Aires giants, Group A winners Argentinos Juniors are seeking their first title since 2010, while Rosario Central, leaders in Group B, could be well positioned to end a 38-year league championship drought. Despite a steady stream of promising players heading abroad, Argentina's production line continues to turn out talent. River remain one of the most important academies and their 17-year-old midfielder Franco Mastantuono has been linked with a move to Manchester United as he attracted attention with his stunning free-kick in last month's Superclasico. Winger Ian Subiabre has also drawn Premier League interest, increasing his playing time in River's attack. The 18-year-old could follow in the footsteps of former teammate Claudio Echeverri, who joined Manchester City after a few senior games. Boca have 19-year-old Milton Delgado, widely regarded as one of the world's top midfield prospects, while Kevin Zenon appears set for European shores after this year's Club World Cup. Rosario Central striker Santiago Lopez has also made a strong impression, scoring twice in his last six regular-season appearances. Beyond national glory, the Apertura champions automatically qualify for the 2026 Copa Libertadores - South America's Champions League - and will contest the Argentine Champions Trophy against the Clausura winners. WHO QUALIFIED? LAST 16 FIXTURES: May 10: San Lorenzo v Tigre Rosario Central v Estudiantes Racing Club v Platense Boca Juniors v Lanus May 11: Independiente v Independiente Rivadavia Argentinos Juniors v Instituto Huracan v Deportivo Riestra May 12: River Plate v Barracas",

    "content": "NAIROBI, May 9 (Reuters) - Ugandan opposition leader and pop singer Bobi Wine said on Friday he plans to run for president for a second time and criticised the West for not speaking out more against \"gross human rights violations\" in the country. Wine, 43, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, will be challenging long-serving President Yoweri Museveni, 80, who is widely expected to seek re-election. \"Yeah, I've expressed my availability on behalf of my team,\" Wine said in an interview with Reuters when asked whether he would stand again in the east African country's next presidential election, due in January. Participation in the election, he said, will also be \"a fighting opportunity to further undress and expose the regime and to further galvanise the people of Uganda to rise up and free themselves.\" Wine came second in the last election in 2021 but rejected the outcome, alleging ballot staffing, falsification of results, beatings and intimidation by soldiers and other irregularities. Government and electoral officials denied the accusations. Wine criticised Western governments for not denouncing what he said were escalating human rights violations, including abductions, illegal detention and torture of his supporters and officials. Wine did not single out any country for criticism. \"Some leaders in the West are complicit in our suffering. They are here to crack their (business) deals and they don't care about human rights,\" he said. \"If they were standing for the values that they profess, then they would be castigating all these gross human rights violations.\" Uganda is considered by the West as an ally in the fight against jihadists and has deployed troops in Somalia. Uganda'sjustice ministersaid this week that Eddie Mutwe, an activist in Wine's National Unity Platform (NUP) party, who also doubles as his personal body guard, appeared to have been tortured while in captivity. Museveni's son and head of the military, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, said he hadkept him in his basementand that he was using him as a punching bag. After missing for a week Mutwe was on Monday produced in court, charged with robbery and remanded. Wine said Mutwe told him he had been electrocuted, waterboarded and beaten. Police spokesman Rusoke Kituma did not respond to a Reuters call for comment on the allegations. Reuters contacted a spokesperson for Uganda's defence forces seeking comment from Kainerugaba. He did not respond. Wine said that if was elected, his priorities would include restoration of political and civil rights and a crackdown on corruption.",

    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - (To receive the full newsletter in your inbox for free sign uphere) Ultrasound waves can penetrate through thick tissues and print medical implants inside a body, experiments in animals suggest. Researchers created 3D implants using focused ultrasound and ultrasound-responsive bioinks delivered via injection or catheter.

Furthermore, the ultrasound imaging allows for real-time monitoring and customized pattern creation, the researchers said. In one experiment, the researchers printed drug-loaded biomaterials that delivered a chemotherapy drug to cancerous sites in a mouse bladder. They found substantially more tumor cell death for several days compared to animals that received the drug through direct injection. \"We have already shown in a small animal that we can print drug-loaded hydrogels for tumor treatment,\" study leader Wei Gao of Caltech said in a statement. \"Our next stage is to try to print in a larger animal model, and hopefully, in the near future, we can evaluate this in humans.\" Acommentary, opens new tabpublished with the paper notes that refinements are still needed. “Printing on organs that expand and contract, such as the lungs, heart, and stomach, presents additional challenges,” the commentary authors note. Healthcare workers who wash their scrubs at home may be unknowingly contributing to the spread of antibiotic-resistant infections in hospitals, researchers warned in a report published inPLoS One, opens new tab. To evaluate whether home washing machines successfully decontaminated healthcare worker uniforms, they washed contaminated fabric swatches in six different consumer-grade washing machines in hot water, using rapid and normal cycles. Half of the machines did not disinfect the clothing during a rapid cycle, while one third failed to clean sufficiently during the standard cycle. After each washing, DNA sequencing of biofilm samples from inside the machines revealed the presence of potentially pathogenic bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes. “Our research shows that domestic washing machines often fail to disinfect textiles, allowing antibiotic-resistant bacteria to survive,” the report’s authors said in a statement. Researchers also found that bacteria can develop resistance to domestic detergents, which also increased their resistance to certain antibiotics. They propose that the laundering guidelines given to healthcare workers should be revised to ensure that home washing machines are cleaning effectively. “If we’re serious about transmission of infectious disease via textiles and tackling antimicrobial resistance, we must rethink how we launder what our healthcare workers wear,” the researchers said.

    "title": "Sonova forecasts double-digit earnings growth, says CEO to step down",
    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - Sonova(SOON.S), opens new tab, the world's largest maker of hearing aids, said on Friday that most of its products should be exempt from U.S. tariffs, as it forecast double-digit earnings growth for the current year and also announced that CEO Arnd Kaldowski was stepping down. Kaldowski, who has been CEO for nearly eight years, will leave at the end of September due to personal reasons and be succeeded by Eric Bernard, a former CEO of hearing care company WS Audiology, Sonova said. The Swiss company said it expects operating earnings before amortisation (EBITA) to grow by 14% to 18% and sales to rise by 5% to 9% in the year through March 2026, after it beat market expectations for 2024/25 results. The outlook assumes no significant additional tariffs beyond those already known, Sonova said. Kaldowski told a call with analysts that a planned new product launch later this year would help boost sales but provided no details of the product. Sonova shares briefly jumped more than 6% as analysts said its full-year forecast was higher than their expectations. The shares were up 2.6% at 1247 GMT. The shares have outperformed sector peers since Sonovareleaseda hearing aid last August, named Sphere Infinio, that utilises real-time artificial intelligence to improve speech clarity from background noise, the first such product in the global market. While Sonova projects slower hearing aid market growth in 2025 at 1% to 3%, versus 5% to 9% growth historically, it expects market share gains and strong business momentum to boost its results. Commenting on the impact of U.S. tariffs, Kaldowski told Reuters that most of its products should be exempt from U.S. tariffs. The Swiss group plans to leverage the so-called Nairobi Protocol, which exempts from tariffs some devices for people with long-term disabilities. Hearing instruments and audiological care businesses, which account for 85% of Sonova's revenue, fall under this protocol, Kaldowski added. The change of CEO means Sonova will be moving ahead with a new leadership team, after it also appointed Elodie Carr-Cingari as finance chief in December. She will start the job in July at the latest. While managerial changes may cause some uncertainty among investors, Kaldowski said Sonova's strong market position made it a good time for such transition. ($1 = 0.8310 Swiss francs)",

    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - Atletico Madrid are focused on ending the season on a high despite the title being out of their reach, coach Diego Simeone said on Friday, a month before the LaLiga side head to the United States to participate in the Club World Cup. Atletico, who host 11th-placed Real Sociedad on Saturday, sit third in the standings on 67 points, 12 points off leaders Barcelona and eight behind second-placed Real Madrid with four games left to play. Atletico's head-to-head record against their rivals ensures their title dream is over, but Simeone does not want his players' focus drifting to the Club World Cup, which kicks off on June 14. \"It's not so easy (to think about the Club World Cup), because the focus is not the same. We have to finish these last four games the best way possible,\" Simeone told a press conference. \"We have the responsibility, especially playing in front of our fans, so let's hope that they will demand more from us tomorrow because obviously that demand will make us enter the game better and hopefully it will lead us to give our all.\" Atletico's form fell away in the second half of the season after suffering a single defeat during their opening 19 matches. \"I think we competed very well in LaLiga until February or March,\" Simeone said. \"The game that probably hurt us the most was (a 2-1 loss) at Getafe. After that came the elimination from the Champions League, then (a defeat against) Barcelona in LaLiga. \"(Until) that moment the feeling was that the team was doing very well. I hope we can finish these four games in the best way to obviously, at least in the league, compete from the place we need to be.\" Asked whether the team's decline in the final stretch of the season had left a bad taste in the mouth, with Atletico winning three of their last eight league games, Simeone disagreed. \"I see that the team is trying to improve, giving their all so that things go as well as possible and, well, we're focusing on a good performance tomorrow,\" the Argentinian coach said.",

The resignation comes just months after Thyberg's predecessor in the high-profile job stepped down and was charged withnegligent handlingof classified information. Thyberg did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment on Friday. But in a statement to daily Dagens Nyheter, Thyberg said that he had failed to disclose the existence of the images. \"These are old pictures from an account I previously had on the dating site Grindr.

    "title": "In Trump's circle, some expect high tariffs even after trade deals",
    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - To hear Donald Trump and some of his advisers tell it, trade tariffs will accomplish many things: stimulate the U.S. economy, bring home manufacturing jobs, raise tax revenues and provide America leverage to renegotiate security deals with its allies. Many economists believe those aims are too sweeping, or downright contradictory. Reuters spoke to half a dozen current and former Trump advisers, some of whom differed sharply on the economic theory behind the president's strategy. But one thing that most of them agreed on was that, once the dust settles from Trump's trade negotiations, America will be left with higher tariffs. Trump's imposition of tariffs on imports last month has angered America's trade partners, slowed the global economy and sent markets into wild gyrations. It defied the consensus underlying the post-World War II global order that free trade leads to peace and prosperity. The Republican president says other countries have exploited that system, leading to a loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs and hurting working-class Americans, many of whom voted for him. But investors, foreign governments and economists have struggled to understand the president's strategy. Stephen Miran, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, the White House’s policy think tank, said Trump was crafting a new trade paradigm for the United States and played down the significance of swings in financial markets and economic data as a \"short-term\" impact. \"Given the historic scope and speed of the president's actions to put American workers on fair ground with the rest of the world, of course there's going to be volatility in the short term,\" Miran said. He said there was an optimal tariff rate for the United States that maximized tax revenues while benefiting the economy. \"I feel very strongly that it's a positive number. It's higher than the two or three percent that came in with this administration,\" Miran said. Higher tariffs would raise hundreds of billions of dollars in tax revenue a year, facilitating domestic tax cuts that he said would stimulate growth. In a paper he published in November, entitled \"A User’s Guide to Restructuring the Global Trading System\", Miran cited research that under certain circumstances the optimal tariff rate for the United States is around 20%. Asked about the paper, Miran said it predated his role in the White House and in no way \"reflects administration policy.\" Peter Navarro, Trump's senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, voiced support for the concept of an optimal tariff, saying in a statement to Reuters that it “clearly indicates a large country can improve its terms of trade by imposing tariffs.” Navarro said trade deficits are undesirable because they shift jobs, production and ownership of assets abroad, which was why countries seek to run surpluses. \"When the deals start coming, as they will, the doubters will be silenced,\" Navarro said. \"This may be the last chance this nation has to turn this Titanic of unfair trade around.\" Trump announceda limited bilateral trade dealwith the UK on Thursday that leaves in place 10% tariffs on British exports, modestly expands agricultural access for both countries and lowers prohibitive U.S. duties on British car exports. The president said more trade deals are in the works, and his team is due to begin talks with China over the weekend. Nouriel Roubini, an economist who rose to prominence for predicting the global credit crisis of 2008, previously worked with Miran and gave him feedback on the November paper on trade. Roubini’s baseline scenario is that tariffs will end up around 10% for most U.S. trading partners and around 60% for China. Under that scenario, inflation would go towards 4% and the economy would stall by the fourth quarter, Roubini said. That would prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, making for \"a short and shallow\" recession. \"If instead, we're well above that, then there's a risk of a real severe recession, U.S. and global,” he added. Trump said on Friday, as representatives prepared for weekend talks, that 80% tariffs on Chinese goods \"seems right\". The U.S. economycontracted in the first quarterfor the first time since 2022, as trade weighed on the data. And opinion polls show thatU.S. voters are growing concernedabout Trump's tariffs and handling of the economy. Lawrence Summers, an economist who served in senior roles under Democratic presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, also said a U.S. recession \"now looks more likely than not\" as a consequence of Trump’s policies. \"There are arguments for limited tariffs with limited objectives but not for the kind of broad-based tariff policies currently being pursued,\" Summers said. Miran said his team had modeled for the impact on the economy if tariff talks dragged on. He rejected concerns about any long-term damage, including to the dollar’s standing as the global reserve currency. \"The doom and gloom stories will fizzle out this time like they do every time,\" he said. After his April 2 tariff announcement, investors tested the president’s resolve by selling U.S. assets, sending the dollar, Treasuries and stocks sharply lower. That raised the specter of thereturn of bond vigilantes- investors who punish bad policy by making it prohibitively expensive for governments to borrow. Trump relented, first suspending tariffs for 90 days to allow time for negotiations, and then making additional concessions. The markets have since recovered most of their losses but the impact of uncertainty around tariffs persists. A key measure ofrisk embedded in Treasury bonds, which captures the premium investors charge for policy uncertainty, remains elevated. Alfonso Peccatiello, chief investment officer of hedge fund Palinuro Capital, said uncertainty over Trump administration policies had increased the odds of bond vigilantism. \"I see bond vigilantes as a serious group of macro investors that rebel against policymaking, and they’re not going to stop until the policymaking is fixed,” Peccatiello said. Arthur Laffer, a long-time economic adviser to Trump, believes the president actually favors free trade. During Trump's first term, Laffer said, they discussed using tariffs to force trade partners to allow freer trade in goods and services. \"I do believe that's what his objective is,\" Laffer said. But the 84-year-old economist sees Trump's gambit as high-risk if the administration doesn’t strike trade deals soon. \"The long-term damage from trade restrictions starts happening pretty quickly,\" he said. Trump has been railing against what he saw as America's bad standing in global trade since long before he entered politics. In a 1987 open letter published as a full-page ad in major U.S. newspapers, he accused wealthy U.S. allies of freeloading off American military protection while running trade surpluses at the expense of the United States. Three decades later when he first came to power, Trump did not act immediately. Wilbur Ross, the former commerce secretary, said the administration had to figure out what powers the executive branch had on trade, independently of Congress. \"We eventually found that there are very extensive ones,\" Ross said. In the second term, Trump has made wide use of executive orders, allowing him to impose or lift tariffs at will. Second-term Trump has other advantages, Ross said, including control over the Republican Party and both houses of Congress. That, combined with steadfast support among his base, has given the president greater freedom to wield tariffs to address not just trade but other issues like national security and combating fentanyl trafficking, he said. Roubini said that - amid a wide spectrum of opinion within the administration on trade – Trump had shown his worldview to be more aligned with hawks like Navarro than with moderates like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. \"The president is as protectionist as Navarro,\" Roubini said. \"It took the market reaction to have them back down.\" In an essay inProject 2025, a set of conservative policy proposals that were published before the 2024 election, Navarro dismissed the idea that everyone benefits from free trade as an \"ivory tower academic conclusion\" that did not mirror the real world. He stated that Trump's protectionist impulse was stymied in the first term by a lack of support in his cabinet, with Jim Mattis, the then-defence secretary, resisting steel and aluminum tariffs. \"Mattis and I went head-to-head on this, and he finally relented, but he fought us at every step,\" Navarro told Reuters. Mattis declined to be interviewed for this article. The differences in opinion have continued in the second administration. Navarro squabbled publicly with billionaire Elon Musk, a key Trump adviser, who called hima \"moron\" for his views on tariffs. Advisers differ at times on fundamental aspects of the economic theory of trade and tariffs. Stephen Moore, who served as a campaign adviser on the economy for Trump but is not in the administration, rejected the argument that global trade was primarily responsible for reducing manufacturing jobs in the United States. Instead, he blamed taxes, regulation and technology for the loss of blue-collar jobs over the years. \"Let's just say this is not conventional free trade economics,\" Moore said. He noted the effort to onshore manufacturing jobs may be misguided: \"In five to ten years, there aren't going to be any factory jobs. All that work is going to be done by robots.\" Laffer said Navarro and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick didn’t understand the economic benefits of running a trade deficit – that dollars used to pay for foreign goods are reinvested in U.S. capital markets: \"We built our country on trade deficits and capital infusions.\" \"Everything he says is just plain wrong,\" Laffer said, referring to Navarro. In response, Navarro pointed to China, saying it had seen foreign investment even as it ran trade surpluses. And he said Trump's tariffs had already drawn large investment commitments. \"It's ironic that the man famous for drawing the optimal tax curve on a napkin\" doesn't understand optimal tariff theory, Navarro said, referring to the \"Laffer curve,\" which posits that cutting tax rates can increase revenues by stimulating economic growth. Lutnick did not respond to requests for comment.",

    "content": "NICOSIA, May 9 (Reuters) - A court in Cyprus sentenced two Hungarian nationals to prison on Friday for brokering sales of properties in the Turkish-held north of the island seized from fleeing Greek Cypriots in a 1974 war. The two women were convicted of advertising and finding buyers for coastal properties without the consent of the registered owners in the territory, which is aTurkish Cypriot staterecognised only by Turkey. Friday's verdict, likely to draw the ire of Turkish Cypriots, highlights the complexity and sensitivity over territory in Cyprus, where thousands of people lost property and homes from internal displacement and a 1974 Turkish invasion triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup. Those properties have since been re-distributed, and bought and sold many times. The territory has recently seen a surge in high-end investment. Cyprus's Criminal Court passed down sentencing of 2.5 years and 15 months jail to the two women, the semi-official Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported. They had pleaded guilty to a number of charges, and prosecutors suspended others. The court is based in the southern part of Cyprus run by its internationally recognised Greek Cypriot government. The women were arrested late last year after arriving in the south. Greek Cypriot authorities have increasingly pursued legal action against foreign nationals investing in disputed properties in north Cyprus in recent years, and the issue is known to have caused friction in attempts torelaunch peace talks. Two other cases are pending before the courts.",

    "content": "BEIJING, May 8 (Reuters) - Ever wished you could understand what your cat is trying to tell you? A Chinese tech company is exploring whether it's possible to translate those mysterious meows into human language using artificial intelligence. Baidu(9888.HK), opens new tab, owner of China's largest search engine, has filed a patent with China National Intellectual Property Administration proposing a system to convert animal vocalisations into human language, according to a patent document published this week. Scientists have long attempted to decode animal communication, and Baidu's patent represents the latest effort to leverage AI to do so. The document says the system will collect animal data, including vocal sounds, behavioural patterns, and physiological signals, which will be preprocessed and merged before an AI-powered analysis designed to recognise the animal's emotional state. The emotional states would then be mapped to semantic meanings and translated into human language. The system could allow \"deeper emotional communication and understanding between animals and humans, improving the accuracy and efficiency of cross-species communication,\" Baidu said in the patent document. \"There has been a lot of interest in the filing of our patent application,\" a Baidu spokesperson said when asked how soon the company could turn the patent into a product. \"Currently, it is still in the research phase.\" Baidu was among the first major Chinese companies to invest heavily in AI following the 2022 debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT. It unveiled itslatest AI model, Ernie 4.5 Turbo, last month, saying it matched the industry's best in several benchmark tests. However, the Ernie chatbot has struggled to gain traction amid fierce competition. A number of efforts are underway outside China to try and interpret what animals want to convey. International researchers atProject CETI(Cetacean Translation Initiative) have been using statistical analysis and AI since 2020 to understand how sperm whales communicate, while the Earth Species Project, a non-profit founded in 2017 whose backers include LinkedIn's Reid Hoffman, is also trying to use AI to decode animal communication. Local media reports about Baidu's patent application sparked discussion on Chinese social media platforms late on Wednesday. While some were excited about the possibility of eventually being better able to understand their pets, others were sceptical. \"While it sounds impressive, we'll need to see how it performs in real-world applications,\" commented a user on Weibo.",

A Reuters survey of 12 analysts had pointed to a rebound of 0.5% in March. On a work day-adjusted year-on-year basis, industrial output was down by 1.8% in March, national statistics bureau ISTAT reported, marking the 26th consecutive decline. On a quarterly basis, in the January-March period industrial output rose for the first time since the second quarter of 2022, with a 0.4% increase versus the fourth quarter of last year, but analysts played down any hope of a lasting pick-up. \"Restart or momentary momentum?\", think tank Prometeia said in a note, forecasting a weak second quarter. Retail lobby Confcommercio said that even the first quarterly increase in almost three years \"can hardly be read as a sign of a trend reversal\". The Italian economygrew by 0.3% in the first quarterfrom the previous three months, preliminary data showed last week, slightly stronger than expectations. That came shortly after Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's governmenthalved its growth forecast for 2025to 0.6%, following a0.7% growth rate in 2024. The outlook is clouded by the prospect of U.S. trade tariffs as well as difficulties faced by Rome in deploying its COVID-19 pandemic recovery funds from the European Union. The Bank of Italy last month forecast that U.S. tariffs, if confirmed, would have anegative impact of more than half a percentage pointon Italian growth in the 2025-2027 period.",

    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - The militant Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) made \"historic decisions\" at a congress this week after a call from its jailed leader to dissolve, a linked news agency said on Friday - a potentially key step in resolving along conflict with Turkey. The Firat news agency reported the PKK as saying it held its congress on May 5-7 in northern Iraq, where the outlawed group is now based. But the PKK statement it published did not say whether the insurgents had decided to disband or disarm. Any PKK decision to formally disarm and dissolve, which is not guaranteed, would have far-reaching political and security consequences for the region, including in neighbouring Syria where Kurdish forces are allied with U.S. forces. It would also give President Tayyip Erdogan a historic opportunity to develop mainly Kurdish southeast Turkey, where violence has killed thousands and hamstrung the regional economy in 40 years of conflict between the PKK and the Turkish state. \"The PKK 12th Congress made decisions of historic importance regarding PKK activities based on the call of Leader Apo,\" the PKK was cited by Firat as saying, referring to PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan who has been imprisoned in Turkey for 26 years. More detailed information would be shared with the public \"very soon,\" it said. Ocalan, who is serving a life sentence, issued a statement on Feb. 27 calling for the PKK to disarm and disband. The PKK is designated a terrorist group by Turkey and its Western allies. There have been intermittent peace efforts over the years, most notably a ceasefire between 2013 and 2015 that ultimately collapsed. The PKKdeclared a ceasefirein March following the disarmament appeal by Ocalan, and its congress announcement had been expected by the pro-Kurdish DEM Party, the third largest in Turkey's parliament. \"We are all awaiting this historic decision with great seriousness and importance,\" DEM Party spokesperson Aysegul Dogan told reporters after a party board meeting. \"This historic opportunity must be made permanent. Weapons must give way to dialogue,\" she said, adding that the DEM hoped for mutual steps toward lasting peace, with political and legal groundwork essential. DEM has played a key role facilitating Ocalan's public call to his PKK, including visits to his island prison near Istanbul, and has since held talks with Erdogan and other government officials seeking to propel the potential peace process. The PKK has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984, mainly focused in the country's southeast. Earlier this week, Erdogan's AK Party spokesperson Omer Celik said the elimination of tensions through the PKK's dissolution and disarmament would strengthen Turkish democracy. \"Every concrete step taken toward ending terrorism, dissolving itself and laying down arms by the terrorist organisation will bring new positive responses and steps. \"It is extremely important for the terrorist organisation to announce its decision to dissolve and lay down arms as soon as possible,\" Celik added.",

    "title": "A gallium lens on China's minerals dominance and how to break it: Andy Home",
    "content": "LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - The price of gallium has been rising ever since China started restricting exports of the exotic metal in August 2023. This is not surprising since China has a near monopoly on global gallium production, just as it does across the critical materials spectrum. How much should we care that the price of something most people have never heard of is trading at 14-year highs? After all, global production last year was just 760 metric tons, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Even at today's elevated prices the world market's nominal value is a modest $550 million. The metal is used in such tiny quantities that there is zero impact on the cost of a mobile phone or an electric vehicle. However, if you're in the semiconductor business it matters a lot. And it matters even more to U.S. defence planners, which is why China chose element number 31 as a metallic pressure point in the first place. Becausegalliumis used in so many modern technological gadgets, there is a multiplier effect to the economic cost of China's export restrictions. The USGSestimates, opens new tabthat a one-year suspension of Chinese gallium exports would translate into a $3.1 billion hit to the U.S. economy. Around half of the decrease would come from the semiconductor sector and the other half from a range of downstream industries such as printed circuit assembly, computers and electric vehicles. China hasn't totally suspended exports, although it hasbanneddirect sales to the United States. But outbound flows have slowed since the dual-use regulations were introduced in 2023. Moreover, the USGS's projections were based on an assumption that the gallium price would rise by a factor of more than 2.5 in the event of a complete export halt. The reality is that the gallium price has more than doubled from $350 per kilogram in July 2023 to $725 and is still rising. The Chinese price, by contrast, is falling as more gallium stays in the domestic market. Physical arbitrage would at other times close the pricing gap but not with China's Ministry of Commerce guarding the gate. Gallium's significance to U.S. military planners is greater still. Indeed, it was the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) that helped develop a compound called gallium arsenide, used in radar and precision-guided weapons, and more recently nurtured the next-generation gallium nitride semiconductor chip. The latter is \"revolutionizing modern radar, allowing new radar modules to track smaller, faster, and more numerous threats from nearly double the distance,\"according to, opens new tabThe Center for Strategic and International Studies, a non-profit policy research organisation. Gallium nitride-enhanced radars are being deployed in the U.S. Army's Lower-Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS), an integral part of Patriot missile defense units, and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. And there's probably a whole lot more that we don't know about. Gallium is typical of many critical metals in that its small market size belies an extraordinarily diverse array of applications, many of them at the cutting edge of semiconductor design. Which is why it's no coincidence that China announced its export controls in direct response to U.S. restrictions on next-generation semiconductor chips to China. Can the West break China's grip on the gallium market? The solution is already at hand, or rather in the tailings pond. Gallium is not particularly rare in the earth's surface but only occurs in sufficient concentrations to extract as a by-product of other minerals, particularly bauxite. China's gallium supremacy has grown alongside its massive build-out of aluminium capacity. The country accounts for 60% of global aluminium output and all that metal needs alumina, which is processed from bauxite. China's alumina refineries aren't the only ones that can generate gallium. It's just that Western companies stopped doing so after China flooded the market at the start of the last decade. That's changing. Rio Tinto(RIO.L), opens new taband Indium Corporation have justannounced, opens new tabthe successful extraction of pure gallium from what was previously a waste stream at Rio's Vaudreuil alumina refinery in Quebec. The next stage will be a pilot plant with capacity of 3.5 tons per year. Greek aluminium producer METLEN(MYTr.AT), opens new tabis planning to produce 50 tons per year by 2028 as part of a project to lift bauxite and alumina processing capacity. It is one of the European Union's 47 strategic minerals projects. There are two key takeaways here for other critical mineral markets being squeezed by Chinese export controls. Firstly, there is a good chance that the West is already producing many of them but has failed until now to appreciate the value of what was deemed part of the metals processing waste scheme. Rio Tinto, for example, has also started extractingscandium, opens new tabfrom its titanium operations in Quebec andtellurium, opens new tabfrom its Kennecott copper smelter in Utah. Both had been operating for many years without anyone thinking it worthwhile to separate out the critical metals in the waste stream. Secondly, it is clear that Western operators are having to learn, or in the case of gallium re-learn, the processing technology needed to separate and refine them. This will take time, particularly since China is in many instances also restricting exports of such technology. But the higher prices ensuing from China's export controls are providing the incentive for ever more Western companies to go back to metallurgy school.

Benko has beenin custodyfor more than three months as the Central Prosecutors' Office for Economic Crimes and Corruption (WKStA) continues its investigation into whether assets that should have gone towards paying back creditors were hidden in a trust of which his immediate family are beneficiaries. Benko has denied the allegations made against him. The WKStA said it had carried out raids in relation to the case on Friday at two locations in Tyrol, the mountainous state in western Austria where Benko lived and founded Signa. The reason for the raids was that the existing investigation was broadened to include the woman, it said, without naming her. \"She is suspected of having helped Signa founder Rene Benko conceal valuable items, thus putting them beyond the reach of administrators and creditors, thereby preventing or reducing the satisfaction of creditors,\" the WKStA said in a statement. \"She is thus suspected of having contributed to the possible criminal offence of insolvency fraud,\" it added. It did not say whether she had been detained. Benko, 47, became a billionaire by tapping low interest rates to rapidly expand his business, acquiring stakes in prestigious properties from Britain's Selfridges department stores to the Chrysler Building in New York. When the tide turned, Signa became the biggest casualty of Europe's property downturn and Benko went bankrupt. Key parts of his empire entered insolvency proceedings or went into liquidation, with administrators trying to salvage what they could of creditors' investments.",

    "content": "NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - An official responsible for implementing Federal Reserve monetary policy said on Friday markets navigated last month’s heavy market stress well, as the central bank moves toward enhancing a key liquidity tool. “Although liquidity in Treasury cash markets became strained in early April, those markets continued to function, in part because of the resilience of funding liquidity in the Treasury repo market,” said Roberto Perli, the manager of the Fed’s System Open Market Account, in the text of a speech prepared for delivery before a conference held by the central bank in Washington. While markets navigated well this period of stress that followed the Trump administration’s announcement of massive trade tariffs on most of the world’s nations, Perli said the experience reaffirmed the need for the central bank to further explore how it can provide fast liquidity to markets. To that end, in response to feedback from the financial community, Perli said that Standing Repo Facility, or SRF, operations will be made available in the morning as well as the afternoon in the “not-too-distant future.” He noted, “These early-settlement auctions, combined with the current afternoon auctions, will enhance the effectiveness of the SRF as a tool for monetary policy implementation and market functioning.” The SRF allows eligible firms to quickly convert Treasury securities into cash at the Fed and is designed to help manage market liquidity needs. It’s been largely dormant since being launched outside ofone pocketof usage last year and was not tapped in any size during the market volatility early last month. The Fed has already offered early day SRF operations around quarter-ends and making that a regular option lines up with market expectations. Despite last month’s market tumult the Fed did not intervene to support markets. Last month Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the orderly nature of the trading even with the volatility meant there was no need forintervention, and he said it would be a high bar for the central bank to step in to help markets.",

To thwart Monte dei Paschi's (MPS) hostile buyout offer, Mediobanca last month unveiledits own acquisition proposalfor private bank Banca Generali(BGN.MI), opens new tab, an asset it has long coveted to grow its wealth management business. Mediobanca CEO Alberto Nagel said his experience as an adviser on financial M&A deals proved banks needed a similar culture and a chance to cut costs through overlaps for mergers to work. \"In the case of the MPS deal with us, all of that does not happen,\" he told a post-result press briefing. MPS, where Italy has been successfully scaling back its presence since late 2023 after rescuing it in 2017, proposes combining Mediobanca's wealth management and investment banking businesses with its own commercial network, where the two lenders already partner in consumer finance. It would cross-sell products through branches and use deposits to finance the other activities while keeping the two entities separate to safeguard the Mediobanca brand. On a call with analysts MPS CEO Luigi Lovaglio thanked Nagel for \"providing his view of what would work best for MPS\" but made clear the bank had other ideas. \"We're wide awake and we have our own vision. We like to challenge ourselves with an innovative and transformational deal,\" he said. To fend off MPS, Mediobanca is proposing to sever its historic ties with Banca Generali's owner Assicurazioni Generali(GASI.MI), opens new tab. It would pay for Banca Generali by distributing the stake that currently makes it the biggest investor in Generali. Generali would end up with around 6.5% of its capital in treasury shares.

A former powerhouse of Italian capitalism as it started as a lender to large companies, Mediobanca would become a major wealth management player focused on top tier clients with Banca Generali, continuing to steer away from commercial banking. In a display of its potential as a partner, MPS grew fees from wealth management and advisory by 21% in the first quarter, helping it tosteady revenuesyear-on-year despite an 8% decline in income from the gap between lending and deposit rates.

Its takeover target Banca Generali also reported a better-than-expectedquarterly net profit. The private bank said the positive result, achieved despite the strong market volatility and a sharp decline of equity indexes, reflected the solidity of its business. It also appointed Deutsche Bank as financial adviser for Mediobanca's offer. MPS posted a 24% yearly profit rise to 413 million euros ($464 million), well above the bank-provided 341 million euro forecast, with costs and loan loss provisions declining.

Pidcock admitted he had become disenchanted on the road before his fall-out with the British team last year but a move to the fledgling Q36.5 Pro Team has worked wonders.

    "content": "WARSAW, May 9 (Reuters) - Poland's main opposition presidential candidate was facing mounting criticism on Friday over his acquisition of an apartment from a vulnerable pensioner, as a poll showed a dip in support and the prime minister labelled him unfit for office. The campaign of Karol Nawrocki, who is backed by the nationalist opposition Law and Justice (PiS) party, has been rocked by allegations that he lied about owning a second property and that he acquired it from a elderly man in return for a promise of care which he did not provide. Nawrocki has called the reports that the elderly man ended up in a state-funded retirement home because he did not provide the care he promised in return for the flat \"media lies\", but said on Wednesday he would give the property to charity. \"In the Polish state, such people... certainly should not seek the highest state honours, the highest dignities, such as the presidency,\" Prime Minister Donald Tusk said on Friday. PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski told parliament he believed the scandal had been orchestrated by Poland's secret services to influence the election, without providing evidence. A survey conducted by Pollster on May 7-8 for the Super Express tabloid showed that support for Nawrocki had dipped by more than 2 percentage points since its previous opinion poll in late April. The poll put liberal Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, from Tusk's ruling Civic Coalition (KO), on 32.3% and Nawrocki on 22.7% ahead of the May 18 first round, with 52% of respondents saying the apartment furore would affect the election outcome. Since the tough-talking amateur boxer-cum-historian entered the race for the presidency he has faced a deluge of negative coverage in liberal media outlets, including the discovery of atelevision interviewin which he appeared in disguise under a pseudonym and praised his own work as a historian.",

    "title": "Europe throws support behind Ukraine special tribunal to prosecute Russia",
    "content": "LVIV, Ukraine, May 9 (Reuters) - Europe threw its support on Friday behind a special tribunal to prosecute President Vladimir Putin and other senior Russian officials for the crime of aggression against Ukraine, a show of unity on a day when Moscow marks its\"victory day\". At a meeting in Ukraine's western city of Lviv, ministers from almost 20 European nations gave their political sign-off to the tribunal, welcoming the completion of the technical work required to set it up. The tribunal will be set up within the framework of the Council of Europe, the continent's leading human rights watchdog that was formed after World War Two to uphold rights and the rule of law. European nations have stepped up their efforts since U.S. President Donald Trump authorisedsanctionsin February against the International Criminal Court, created to prosecute war crimes when member states are unwilling or unable to do so themselves. Russia denies its troops have committed atrocities in Ukraine since its forces launched a full-scale invasion in February 2022. Ukraine says Russian troops have committed many thousands of war crimes. Foreign ministers from the so-called 'core group' of at least 37 countries signed the \"Lviv statement\", a document marking the conclusion of work done to draft the necessary legal instruments for the tribunal. The tribunal could start operating next year. \"This tribunal will ensure that those most responsible for the aggression against Ukraine are held accountable,\" EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas told reporters Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said it was a moral duty for Europe to hold Russia accountable for the war. \"A strong tribunal for the crime of aggression can - and must - make any potential aggressor think twice,\" he said in a video address to the meeting. An EU official said the tribunal would need to respect the immunity of Putin and his officials while in office but added a prosecutor would be able to investigate and prepare a proposed indictment for when that immunity dropped. Dutch Justice Minister David van Weel welcomed the move. \"I think it is a good step because it fills a void that currently exists, which is how can you prosecute the leadership for the crime of aggression against another country,\" he told Reuters in Kyiv. Earlier, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal led ministers to a military cemetery in Lviv to honour some of the tens of thousands of Ukrainians killed during more than three years of war against Russia. The images were in stark contrast to the show of military might in Moscow, where Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping attended a parade to mark the 80th anniversary of the World War Two defeat of Nazi Germany. Drawing a parallel with the allied victory in World War Two, British foreign minister David Lammy said 80 years later \"in Ukraine we are (again) on the frontlines of that fight for freedom ... sending a powerful message to Putin and his cronies and those that stand with him that freedom will prevail\". European nations are trying to ramp up the pressure on Putin to accept an unconditional 30-day ceasefire, as proposed by the United States. Separately, Britain on Fridayannounceda new package of sanctions on Russia's so-called shadow fleet. Ukraine has been pushing for the creation of a special tribunal since early in the conflict, accusing Russian troops of committing many thousands of war crimes, but is also intent on prosecuting Russians for orchestrating the 2022 invasion. The ICC has issued an arrest warrant against Putin over the deportation of Ukrainian children. Moscow says the warrant is meaningless, and \"null and void\". But the ICC cannot prosecute Russian officials for the crime of aggression in Ukraine because Russia is not a member of the Rome Statute, which created the court, and Ukraine was not a full member at the time of the invasion. For the ICC to prosecute the crime of aggression, members must also sign an additional amendment.",

    "content": "May 9 - In the past, trips to Seattle almost have felt like home games for the Toronto Blue Jays. Thousands of fans from across western Canada usually flock south of the border to cheer on their country's lone MLB franchise. But it appears that might not be the case this weekend when the teams open a three-game series Friday night. President Donald Trump's threat of tariffs and rhetoric about Canada becoming the 51st state apparently will keep many Blue Jays fans at home. Denny Heck, the lieutenant governor of Washington, told Global News that reservations for this weekend were down by half. \"I have to put my country over my team and really send a message with my money,\" Blue Jays fan Arthur Gallant told the Canadian news organization. The Blue Jays could use all the support they can get. They had lost four in a row before rallying from a four-run deficit to defeat the Los Angeles Angels 8-5 on Thursday night in Anaheim, Calif. Daulton Varsho went 3-for-4 with a double, home run and three RBIs, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. also had three hits and Anthony Santander had a go-ahead, two-run single in a four-run sixth inning for the Blue Jays. The eight runs matched Toronto's season high. Meanwhile, the Mariners have won nine straight series -- including taking two of three games in Toronto on April 18-20 -- to move into first place in the American League West. It's the Mariners' longest streak since the record-tying 116-win 2001 team won 15 straight series. Surprisingly, the Mariners have been winning with two of their starting pitchers -- Logan Gilbert and George Kirby -- on the injured list. \"It's just a little bit of everything,\" said Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh, who is tied for the major-league lead with 12 home runs. \"We're taking walks, grinding out at-bats, taking our hits through the middle of (the) field and other ways. It's not the sexiest, but, you know, that's kind of how baseball is.\" The Mariners had Thursday off after rallying from a five-run deficit to defeat the Athletics 6-5 Wednesday afternoon in West Sacramento, Calif. Rowdy Tellez hit a three-run homer and Leody Taveras, making his M's debut, drove in the tying run and scored the winner. \"It's almost like a broken record,\" Mariners manager Dan Wilson said, \"just how well these guys keep fighting and come back.\" Friday's series opener is scheduled to feature a pair of veteran right-handers in Toronto's Kevin Gausman (2-3, 3.83 ERA) and Seattle's Luis Castillo (3-2, 3.29). Gausman is winless in three starts since April 15, though he allowed just one hit in six scoreless innings Saturday against Cleveland in a no-decision. He's 1-4 with a 2.77 ERA in 11 career appearances versus the Mariners. Castillo had a streak of two straight wins snapped Saturday at Texas when he didn't get a decision despite giving up just one run on four hits in six innings. He's 2-2 with a 3.90 ERA in five career starts against the Blue Jays, beating them 8-3 on April 20. --Field Level Media",

IHG reported 3.5% growth in U.S. room revenue for the three months ended March 31 on Thursday, compared with a 1.9% fall last year.

IHG said its on-the-books global revenue growth had continued into the second quarter, while noting some softening of forward economic indicators. The group, known for its budget-friendly Holiday Inn and Avid Hotel brands, is banking on U.S. domestic demand to support growth as international travel to the U.S. cools. A rebound in the U.S. market has helped it counter sluggish demand in China. However, the hotel operator expects fiscal 2025 revenue per available room (RevPAR) to come a little below analysts' consensus of 2.3%, chief financial officer Michael Glover said in a call with analysts. \"IHG is a largely mid-market franchise hotel business, and we expect it would be resilient in an economic slowdown\" Peel Hunt analysts said in a note, adding that they believe its shares are undervalued. As of Wednesday's close, IHG's shares have slumped 13.5% in 2025, compared to Hilton's 2.2% dip and Marriott's 8.2% drop. Shares in the London-listed company were up 2.3% at 8,808 pence at 1352 London time.

    "title": "Pope Leo’s first appearance reveals three big clues about his papacy",
    "content": "VATICAN CITY, May 8 (Reuters) - From his first moments on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica,Pope Leo XIVgave three important clues about what kind of leader of the 1.4-billion-member Catholic Church he will be. Leo, formerly U.S. Cardinal Robert Prevost, waselected by the world's cardinalson Thursday as the new pope on the second day of the conclave to choose a successor toPope Francis, who died last month. He is the first pope from the United States, but holds dual citizenship in Peru, where he was a missionary for decades before becoming a cardinal. Leo's first clue was his choice of name. Popes often use this choice to sendtheir first major signalabout the priorities of their new papacy. Francis took his name from the 13th century St. Francis of Assisi, who rejected wealth and wanted to care for the poor. The last pope to take the name Leo, Leo XIII, focused much of his 1878-1903 papacy on advocating for the rights of workers, calling for fair pay, fair working conditions, and the right to join unions. \"By picking the name Leo XIV, he shows he is committed to the social teaching of the church,\" said Rev. Thomas Reese, a Jesuit commentator who follows the papacy closely. Leo's second clue was his choice of language and the words he spoke, which put a clear emphasis on the need for peace, something Francis also often focused on. None of his speech to the crowds gathered in St. Peter's Square was in English, but rather Italian, the language of the papacy, and a brief foray into Spanish to greet his former community in Peru. He did not mention the U.S. \"La pace sia con tutti voi!\" (Peace be with you!), Leo's first words in public, echoed the ones Catholics use in their celebrations but also offered an immediate message of peace in a world riven with conflict. Before heading into thesecret conclaveon May 7, the world's cardinals issued a statement lamenting the conflicts \"in Ukraine, the Middle East, and many other parts of the world\" and making a \"heartfelt appeal\" for peace. The new pope said he wanted to share God's peace, calling it \"a disarmed peace and a disarming peace\" that is \"humble and persevering.\" Leo also mentioned Francis, who offered his last blessing to crowds in Rome on Easter Sunday, the day before he died of a stroke after battling double pneumonia for weeks. \"We still have in our ears that weak, but always courageous voice of Pope Francis,\" he said. Leo asked permission to offer the same blessing Francis used just a few weeks ago, saying: \"God loves us, God loves everyone, and evil will not prevail. We are in the hands of God.\" Leo's third clue was in his choice of attire. Unlike Francis, who spurned all the trappings of the papacy including on the first day he was elected in 2013, Leo wore a traditional red papal garment over his white cassock. Although Leo follows in the tradition of Francis, he signalled he is a new, and different, pope.",

Goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, Achraf Hakimi, Marquinhos, Nuno Mendes, Willian Pacho, Fabian Ruiz and Vitinha have been given time off and will not return to training until Wednesday. \"We have a set plan which depends on playing time and travelling throughout the season. You have to balance all that out to arrive in the best possible condition for both finals,\" Luis Enrique said ahead of Saturday's trip to Montpellier. \"When the Champions League final is over, the vast majority will go to the national team. Every player needs a personalised plan. We've managed that, but there are still the final matches to achieve our objectives. \"The players need to arrive mentally fresh ... We're playing against Montpellier and Auxerre (next weekend), which will help us stick to our plan. There are a lot of players and we're managing it individually.\" Luis Enrique said Ousmane Dembele is fully fit after the club's top scorer with 33 goals this season only came on as a second-half substitute in Wednesday's Champions League semi-finalvictory over Arsenal. \"Ousmane Dembele is perfectly fine. He trained with the team today, he wanted to come,\" the Spaniard said. \"He had permission from the staff not to come, it's what we considered adequate rest time. But if he needs to come, he's completely free to do so.\" PSG will be playing in their second Champions League final after losing to Bayern Munich in 2020 and Luis Enrique said the French club deserve to win the title after such a long wait. \"If a team deserves to win, after waiting so long, it's PSG. I know the club was founded the year I was born (in 1970). Let's hope this connection proves true and we can secure the Champions League,\" he said. \"The problem is that there will definitely be one team that won't succeed ... but I hope we win.\"",

To receive the full newsletter in your inbox for free sign uphere. Hello! We're continuing with the theme of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) rollbacks in the United States this week, but this time, I’ll also be looking beyond government actions to examine developments in the corporate sphere. Let’s start with anti-ESG executive orders from President Donald Trump’s administration. This week, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed Trump's administration to implement his ban ontransgender peoplein the military. The president's directive was one of a series of steps he has taken to curb transgender rights. The ban will allow the armed forces to discharge the thousands of current transgender troops and reject new recruits while legal challenges play out. The court granted the Justice Department's request to lift a federal judge's nationwide order blocking the military from carrying out Trump's prohibition on transgender people serving in the military. The court has a 6-3 conservative majority. Its three liberal justices - Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson - publicly dissented from the decision. Detaining students Elsewhere, the Trump administration urged a U.S. appeals court to allow immigration authorities to continue todetain two students– Rumeysa Ozturk from Tufts University and Mohsen Mahdawi from Columbia University – who were arrested after engaging in pro-Palestinian advocacy on campus. The administration wants their deportation challenges to be handled exclusively in immigration courts, not federal district courts, while the students' attorneys argue that their clients were unlawfully detained for making constitutionally protected statements critical of Israel's actions during the Gaza war. Mahdawi, born in a refugee camp in the West Bank, said he was arrested last month upon arriving for an interview for his U.S. citizenship petition in Vermont in retaliation for his advocacy against Israel's war and role in student protests. Lawyers for Ozturk, a Turkish national and PhD student, say she was arrested in March for co-authoring a pro-Palestinian opinion piece in Tufts' student newspaper. \"She has been held behind bars for six weeks while her health deteriorates for writing an op-ed,\" said Esha Bhandari, her lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union. Judges have expressed concerns over the legality of their prolonged detentions without court access, highlighting tensions between immigration enforcement and First Amendment rights. What about corporate? Reuters sustainable business correspondentRoss Kerberexplored what some companies have been doing since the Trump administration’s campaign against federal and corporate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts. He found that U.S. companies are reporting fewer race and gender details about their directors. Kerber spoke to Josh Ramer, CEO of New Jersey company DiversIQ which tracks disclosures for investors and corporate clients who was shocked by the extent of the pullback. Among S&P 500 companies making proxy filings this year, 54% gave fewer director demographic details than in 2024; last year only 7% of those companies gave fewer details.Click herefor the full column. Berkshire Hathaway, ABA and Novo Nordisk This week, Berkshire Hathaway shareholdersrejected a resolutionrequiring the company to report on risks from its subsidiaries' race-based initiatives, one of seven proposals tied to diversity, artificial intelligence and other issues that were voted down. Shareholders also voted against a resolution that Berkshire report on how its business practices affect employees based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin and political views. Meanwhile, the American Bar Association will extend thesuspension of its law school diversityand inclusion rule through August 2026. The ABA’s Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admission to the Bar will consider a recommendation to further defer enforcement of its longstanding diversity rule, which was first suspended in February after Trump’s series of anti-DEI executive orders. Elsewhere, the obesity drugmaker Novo Nordisk said it willdrop gender representationrequirements for senior leadership positions in its U.S. business due to the executive orders by Trump to stop DEI initiatives. In its first-quarter earnings statement, the company said that its U.S. operations will be excluded from meeting its global minimum 45% representation for each gender by the end of 2025.

    "title": "NTT generously models Japan's next wave of buyouts",
    "content": "HONG KONG, May 9 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Nippon Telegraph and Telephone(9432.T), opens new tabis doing its state backers a favour. The Japanese telecom company, in which the Ministry of Finance holds a roughly one-third stake, is offering to buy out the 42% it doesn't already own of its subsidiary NTT Data(9613.T), opens new tabfor 2.37 trillion yen ($16.4 billion). That's a chunky premium for minority shareholders. But it models a type of dealmaking officials want to see more of in Japan. The $86 billion acquirer says its cash flow and financing capabilities will help the subsidiary, which was listed in 1995, strengthen its presence in North America and upgrade data centre infrastructure as demand for artificial intelligence increases. Official pressure may also be a factor driving the deal. The government wants Japan Inc. to use capital more efficiently to ultimately support the economy. Bourse operator Japan Exchange Group has been running a campaign to remove conflicts of interest between parent companies and their subsidiaries' minority shareholders. These messy dual-listing structures are common in Japan; Nippon Telegraphadmits, opens new tabthe deal to absorb its subsidiary will simplify the relationship. This type of consolidation will drive the next wave of Japanese buyouts. Of all the large M&A deals currently on the table in the country, Nippon Telegraph's deal is the most likely to succeed. By contrast, a potential $42 billion offer from Toyota Motors Chair Akio Toyoda to buy Toyota Industries(6201.T), opens new tablooks likescrap value. Nippon Telegraph is offering, at 4,000 yen per share, a price the stock last hit around the dotcom bubble. Getting up there this time involved the subsidiary pushing back against its parent. Filingsreleased, opens new tabon Thursday show the buyer initially proposed to pay 3,200 yen per share last month and increased the amount on four occasions: on Friday morning the target's shares were trading just below the buyout price. It all means that Nippon Telegraph is paying a huge 67% premium, or $6.6 billion, to when it started negotiating with its target. Covering that might mean finding annual savings of about 140 billion yen, almost $1 billion, or a punchy 15% of NTT Data's operating expenses in the year to the end of March 2025, once taxed – at the 31% rate the company tends to pay – and capitalised. NTT has a track record of making generous buyout offers, such as when it absorbed NTT Docomo five years ago in a larger deal. However, companies are so undervalued in Japan that high premiums are likely to be a feature of the many more deals to come. It's fitting that a state-backed company is devising a model for how to get deals done. Japanese telecom provider Nippon Telegraph and Telephone on May 8 announced a tender offer to buy all the shares of NTT Data that it doesn't already own, valuing the information technology services company at 5.6 trillion yen ($38.8 billion). At 4,000 yen per share, the offer represents a premium of 34% to NTT Data's closing share price on May 7, and of 67% to the closing price on April 7 before the two parties started negotiating a deal. NTT currently owns 57.7% of NTT Data. The tender offer period will run from May 9 to June 19.",

Yet even Uncle Sam’s greatest fan is implicitly questioning whether the days of U.S. outperformance are over. When he announced plans tobow outon Saturday, Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway(BRKa.N), opens new tabwas less focused on America Inc than ever before, with over half of its investment portfolio in cash and its highest ever weighting to non-U.S. assets.

The entirety of the country’s economic history, quipped the Treasury secretary, can be distilled in just five words: “Up and to the right.” In whom should investors trust: Buffett or Bessent? Is the era of U.S. investment outperformance over – or is it here to stay? The greenback’s recent slide raises a third possibility: both might be true at once. For domestic investors, who count their gains in dollars, U.S. assets may continue to power ahead – even as the opposite might be true for foreigners, who are exposed to currency risk. Much like the weird world of quantum physics, where particles have no fixed position until they’re observed, the existence of U.S. exceptionalism may increasingly depend on an investor’s perspective. The last decade of U.S. investment dominance has had three underlying drivers. The first was simple: unprecedented fiscal largesse. President Donald Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act slashed levies. President Joe Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act ramped up spending. The net result was that the U.S. budget deficit climbed from 3.5% of GDP in 2015 to nearly 6% in 2019, using the International Monetary Fund’s measure of general government net borrowing, before rebounding again to nearly 7.5% of GDP in 2024. At 3.7%, the average budget deficit of the other members of the G7 group of advanced economies was barely half the United States’s level last year. With Trump’s second coming, austerity looks further away than ever. Congressional budget resolutions passed in early April imply massive tax cuts and relatively puny spending cuts, potentiallyadding, opens new tab$5.7 trillion to federal debt over the next decade, according to Reuters. The International Monetary Fund reckons the U.S. deficit will still be 5.6% of GDP in 2028, against an average for the rest of the G7 of 3.4%. Importantly for investors, the U.S. Treasury market is unfazed: the benchmark 10-year yield is currently lower than at the beginning of the year. There’s little opposition from either policymakers or markets to keeping the U.S. fiscal engine firing. The next big driver of U.S. outperformance has been its leadership in technology and artificial intelligence, exemplified by the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks – Microsoft(MSFT.O), opens new tab, Apple(AAPL.O), opens new tab, Nvidia(NVDA.O), opens new tab, Amazon.com(AMZN.O), opens new tab, Alphabet(GOOGL.O), opens new tab, Meta Platforms(META.O), opens new tab, and Tesla(TSLA.O), opens new tab– which account for roughly a third of the S&P 500 Index’s(.SPX), opens new tabmarket capitalisation. The bull case for this theme is that America’s technological edge is sustainable and poised to have profound macroeconomic effects. New York University economist Nouriel Roubiniargues, opens new tabthat the U.S. leads the rest of the world in 10 of 12 “industries of the future”, from defence to fusion energy, and that the ongoing AI investment boom will see the economy’s potential growth rate to approach 4% by 2030, from around 2% to 3% in recent years. Sceptics see a bubble instead. Jim Chanos, founder of short-selling specialist Kynikos Associates, observes that while U.S. tech capex indeed contributed nearly a full percentage point to GDP in the first quarter of 2025, thelast time it did so, opens new tabwas right before the peak of the dot-com bubble in early 2000. In contrast to the fiscal engine, financial markets have recently been wobbling on this second theme. U.S. equities have had a wild 2025. Tech stocks and Tesla have been particularly hit. Yet the S&P 500 has roared back from a near-20% drawdown in early April and is now just 4% below its 2024 year-end level. Faith in the Magnificent Seven may be dented – but there’s little sign yet that Uncle Sam’s tech engine has ground to an ignominious halt. That leaves the third driver of U.S. outperformance: the long bull market in the dollar. In the decade to March 2024, the U.S. dollar appreciated by nearly 30% against the euro, for example, which improved euro-based investors' returns to investing in U.S. financial assets by nearly 3 percentage points per year. For investors in equities, these currency gains were a nice little add-on, topping up the S&P 500’s annualised 13% total return in U.S. dollars to 16%. For fixed-income investors, they were the major draw given that yields were languishing at multi-decade lows. In 2025, however, this third mighty engine of U.S. exceptionalism has gone into reverse. The United States’s net international investment liabilities havereached, opens new taban all-time high of nearly 90% of GDP, and the net flow of income from its international assetshas completely dried up, opens new tab. The Bank for International Settlements’real effective exchange, opens new tabrate index, meanwhile, rates the greenback as about as expensive as at any time in 40 years. Combined with the White House’s open endorsement of a weaker currency, that’s resulted in a screeching handbrake turn. The DXY U.S. Dollar Currency Index has dropped by 8% this year. The greenback’ssharp depreciationthis week against a number of Asian currencies suggests further weakness may be on the way. Is it worth investing in U.S. markets even if they’re powered by only two of their three historic engines? That depends on where you sit. U.S. assets may do just fine in dollar terms, fuelled by continued American leadership in tech and turbocharged by further fiscal boosts. For foreign investors, however, American assets will be less compelling if a bear market in the greenback leaves them racing to stand still. Such confusing quantum states have existed for long periods before. In the half-decade leading up to April 2008, for example, the S&P 500 returned just over 13% annually in dollar terms – just like in the decade to 2024. But the greenback was on the skids, losing nearly a third of its value over that time. For an unhedged euro-based investor, those exceptional returns were thus cut almost in half. Of course, U.S. investors too can get on the right side of the trade simply by buying foreign assets. Buffett himself opined on Saturday that he “wouldn’t want to be owning anything that we thought was in a currency that was really going to hell.” That may prove a valuable parting shot from the Oracle of Omaha.

    "title": "Buyout barons struggle to heed Buffett doctrine",
    "content": "NEW YORK, May 8 (Reuters Breakingviews) - As Warren Buffett steps back, some of the world’s biggest money managers will try to keep building on his legacy. They already ape the outgoing Berkshire Hathaway(BRKa.N), opens new tabCEO’s best idea, tapping insurance funds to invest. The harder part now will be to equal his extraordinary patience. Buffett lieutenant Ajit Jain hasceded, opens new tabto private equity firms embracing the idea of using gigantic pools of customer premiums paid to cover anything from death or retirement costs to auto policies as a source of capital. He says Berkshire is “no longer competitive in this space” because so-called alternative asset managers borrow more and have higher tolerances for risk. Apollo Global Management(APO.N), opens new taband KKR(KKR.N), opens new tab, like Berkshire, own insurers; Blackstone(BX.N), opens new taband Carlyle(CG.O), opens new tabsit between underwriters and the returns they desire. Berkshire famously uses its hefty balance sheet to buy stocks, like Apple(AAPL.O), opens new tab, and companies such as railroad operator Burlington Northern Santa Fe outright. The buyout foursome is seeding big lending businesses, ferreting out assets like once-esoteric securities. Steve Schwarzman’s Blackstone alone oversees some $240 billion of insurance funds and another $270 billion from individual investors. If it’s not put to work soon, it will drag down returns and make it harder to raise more money later. Buffett typically hangs onto his portfolio of companies, such as Benjamin Moore paints and See’s candies, but buyout shops are eager to sell theirs and havestruggledto do so because of wild market swings and the gaps in valuation assessments they create. Buffett’s arduous task has been hunting elephants, as he calls the gargantuan acquisitions required to influence his $1 trillion conglomerate. Carlyle and its peers have instead built huge pipes through which deals must constantly flow. Apollo’s Athene business is the country’s largest annuity issuer. Boss Marc Rowan said it once consumed “everything we produced and more,” but insists it is more conservative when needed, evidenced partly by Athene’s slightlyshrunken, opens new tabfirst-quarter profit as it built up cash and investment income lagged rising costs. Size can be a strength, as Buffett has proved, especially when times are tougher. The bewildering array of strategies enlisted by private equity’s big four should be in a similar position. Carlyle’s AlpInvest dabbles insecondhand buyout-fund stakes, which are now flowing into the market. Itsquarterly earnings, opens new tabmore than doubled from a year earlier, making more available to distribute to shareholders than Wall Street was expecting, per Visible Alpha data. This diversity helps them copy the Oracle of Omaha in other ways, too. Blackstone, for example, unveiled a $5 billiondeal, opens new tablast month to help struggling Canadian wireless carrier Rogers Communications, evoking in some ways Berkshire’s $5 billion purchase of preferred stock in Goldman Sachs as the financial crisis took hold. Apollo’s Hybrid Value business, which by blending debt and equity financing is a good fit for these kinds of deals, returned 19% over the past year. KKR follows Buffett most directly, even declaring that it is building a “mini Berkshire, opens new tab” by holding companies on its balance sheet to generate steady dividends. Such payoutsincreased, opens new tab52% from the first three months of 2024. Even so, investing wisely, especially nowadays, requires restraint, which Buffett put to good use for 60 years. Buyout firms are unable to play as long a waiting game. Follow@JMAGuilford, opens new tabon X CONTEXT NEWS Private equity firm Carlyle said on May 8 that it generated $413 million in after-tax earnings available to be distributed to shareholders in the first quarter, 13% more than a year earlier. Rival investment shop Apollo Global Management said on May 2 that its equivalent metric, adjusted net income, grew 5% year-over-year, to $1.1 billion. Earnings from its insurance unit, Athene, fell roughly 2% to $804 million as funding and interest costs outpaced rising investment income. KKR said on May 1 that its adjusted net income increased 20%, to more than $1 billion, from the same three-month stretch in 2024. The asset manager’s Strategic Holdings business, which comprises stakes in portfolio companies it plans to keep on its balance sheet long-term, grew earnings 52%, to $31 million. Blackstone on April 17 reported that its distributable earnings rose 11% from a year earlier to $1.4 billion. Capital inflows of roughly $62 billion jumped 81%, leaving the firm with $177 billion.",

    "title": "Diamondbacks take aim at Roki Sasaki, Dodgers in rematch",
    "content": "May 9 - Let the rivalry resume. The Diamondbacks and Los Angeles Dodgers got their first look at each other Thursday, when Arizona benefited from Gabriel Moreno's fourth-inning grand slam and 6 1/3 scoreless innings from Brandon Pfaadt for a 5-3 win in the opener of a four-game set in Phoenix. The record between the last two teams to represent the National League in the World Series is now even over the last two-plus seasons. The teams each won eight of the 16 games in 2023, although the Diamondbacks recorded a three-game sweep in the NL Division Series. The Dodgers went 7-6 against Arizona in 2024. Both teams relish the rivalry. \"We love to compete against the Dodgers,\" Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said. \"They are an elite franchise. They have done it for a long time. Whenever they come into town, it is exciting.\" Dodgers' rookie right-hander Roki Sasaki (1-1, 3.86 ERA) will oppose Arizona left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez (1-3, 5.92) on Friday. Sasaki, like Los Angeles' Yoshinobu Yamamato on Thursday, will make his first start of the season on five days' rest. He and Yamamoto had stuck to a once-a-week regimen, but rotation injuries and a schedule that includes 10 games in 10 days mandated a change. \"We seem to bring out the best in them,\" Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. \"It's an athletic team. They really defend well. They are good on the bases. Playing in the same division, obviously there is a lot of familiarity. It could be a fun series.\" Sasaki has been a staple in the rotation since the Japan Series in Tokyo on March 18-19, but he did not get his first victory until his last outing, a 10-3 victory at Atlanta last Saturday. Sasaki threw a season-high 98 pitches and gave up three runs for the second consecutive contest, but he benefited from seven runs in the first three innings and cruised. \"That's the plan,\" Roberts said about keeping Sasaki on five days' rest between starts. \"There might be other days with six days' of rest, given the off days,\" Sasaki has better splits in four road starts than in three at home - 3.50 ERA and 15 strikeouts in 18 innings. Rodriguez has struggled in his last three starts, giving up 16 runs in 16 innings since a 6-4 victory at Miami on April 17. He had 10 strikeouts in his last outing, a no-decision in the Diamondbacks' 11-9 victory at Philadelphia on Sunday. He is one of eight major leaguers with at least two double-digit strikeout games this season. \"I would prefer to go seven (innings) with two (strikeouts),\" Rodriguez said. \"That's my main reason to go out there. I feel like when I strike out a lot of guys, I go five innings and 100 pitches. So for me, I try to get contact, and if I get a guy to strike out with three or four pitches, that will be great. \"I don't call myself a strikeout pitcher. I'm here to try to give the team the opportunity to win the game every time I go out there.\" Rodriguez is 1-4 with a 6.00 ERA in five career meetings versus the Dodgers. --Field Level Media",

The 27-year-old Wan-Bissaka had turned down previous approaches from the Congolese to play for them, notably ahead of last year’s Cup of Nations finals in the Ivory Coast. His family hails from DR Congo but he has played for England at under-21 level and earned a first senior England call-up at the start of the 2019-20 season, having made an impressive start with Manchester United following a move from Crystal Palace. However, he had to withdraw from the England squad through injury and never got called up again. Wan-Bissaka, who joined Premier League side West Ham last year, would have to switch international allegiance to play for the Congolese but FIFA’slatest, opens new tablist of players who have been allowed to make nationality changes does not include him. DR Congo, under coach Sebastien Desabre, are using the two friendly matches in Orleans, France against Mali on June 5 and Madagascar three days later to prepare for the resumption of the World Cup qualifiers, where they lead Senegal by a point at the top of Group B and host them in a key match in September. The winners of each group qualify directly for the finals. DR Congo will also compete at the Cup of Nations tournament in Morocco at the end of the year, drawn in the same group with Benin, Botswana and Senegal.",

    "content": "BUDAPEST/LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - Ratings agency S&P Global has warned that the current political upheaval in Romania is putting the country's coveted investment grade credit rating under increasing threat. Romania's financial markets were rattled this week after hard-right presidential candidate George Simion's victory in afirst-round votedeepened a political crisis in central Europe's second-largest economy. Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacuresignedfollowing the result, triggering the collapse of the pro-Western coalition government and causing widespread concern about the country's already strained finances. Apollshowed Simion, a vocal Eurosceptic, winning the deciding May 18 run-off election. S&P warned that policymaking would become more fragmented and less stable over the next few months, regardless of the outcome, and result in \"weaker growth, fiscal, and external outcomes than our already pessimistic assumptions.\" Romania is currently rated BBB- by both S&P and Fitch, and an equivalent Baa3 by Moody's. All three have a \"negative\" outlook. They are the lowest rating in the investment grade category, meaning that any downgrade will lead to a drop into the so-called \"junk\" bracket. That tends to put off conservative international investors and, therefore, push up borrowing costs. Bucharest already runs the European Union's biggest budget deficit, exceeding 9% of GDP. Its main funding avenues are also affected by the political situation, S&P said, with access to the Eurobond market \"weakened ... leading to pressure on the exchange rate and the domestic bond market.\" Romania's currency, the leu, has fallen nearly 3% against the euro, forcing the central bank to step in to try and stabilise it. Bank of America economists said they expect Fitch to downgrade Romania's rating by one notch in August, as the increased probability of a nationalist president and a change in government add risks to Romania's fiscal consolidation path. \"This, in turn, in our view means the EU could consider suspending funds in June-July and a ratings downgrade also looks hard to avoid.\" Romania's economy grew just 0.8% last year, the slowest pace since the COVID-19 pandemic, with one large employers' group warning this week that the political turmoil could push the country intorecession. Sunday's shock first round result has also seen its 10-year government bond yield, a proxy of the interest rate the government pays on its borrowings, shoot up some 100 basis points to its highest level since November 2022. JPMorgan analysts have warned of a 15-20% devaluation of the leu versus the euro if the instability worsens after the deciding second-round vote. The central bank likely spent anywhere between 5 to 10 billion euros of its foreign exchange reserves in the pastfew daysto shore up the leu, based on estimates by economists and investment banks. S&P's post-election scenarios include the potential for an unstable minority government that would try to move ahead with fiscal consolidation, or early parliamentary elections which would further delay budget cuts. A third, more optimistic, scenario considers the formation of a unity government with sufficient backing for fiscal stabilisation.",

    "title": "Reeling Rockies aim to play better 'brand of baseball' vs. Padres",
    "content": "May 9 - The Colorado Rockies wrapped up a home series against the best team in the American League and now face one of the better clubs in the National League. Colorado lost three games to the Detroit Tigers, including dropping both ends of Thursday's doubleheader by a combined score of 21-3. The Rockies, who have lost six straight, need to regroup in a hurry when they host the San Diego Padres on Friday in Denver. Colorado will send Antonio Senzatela (1-5, 5.50 ERA) to the mound against San Diego's Randy Vasquez (1-3, 3.90) on Friday night in a battle of right-handers. The Rockies are on a historic pace, a journey they want to stop. Colorado is 6-31 to begin 2025 and has fewer wins at this point than the Chicago White Sox last season. The White Sox went on to set the major league record for losses in the modern era with 121. Thursday's first game was a mix of starter Kyle Freeland's ineffectiveness and the Rockies' poor defense. They had three errors that led to four unearned runs. \"Some of the young guys have got to realize the importance of defense,\" manager Bud Black said. The struggles have amplified the difference between Colorado and teams like Detroit and San Diego. \"What they're doing is right and what we're doing is wrong,\" Freeland said. \"We're not winning baseball games. We're playing a bad brand of baseball -- all around. Pitching, hitting, fielding.\" The Rockies hope Senzatela can get the weekend off on a good note. The righty is slated to make his eighth start of the season, which is already more than the five he had in the last two seasons combined. Friday will be his 20th appearance and 14th start against the Padres. He is 8-4 with a 3.26 ERA in his previous 19 games. San Diego comes to Denver after dropping its last two contests of a three-game series at the New York Yankees. Padres starter Dylan Cease carried a no-hitter into the seventh inning Wednesday night before New York rallied to win in 10 innings. Vasquez will attempt to end San Diego's short losing streak in his fourth career start against Colorado. He is 0-1 with a 7.94 ERA in his previous outings against the Rockies and lasted just 2 2/3 innings in his one start in Denver. Padres outfielder Jackson Merrill returned to the lineup on Tuesday night after missing a month with a right hamstring injury. He showed no rust in the two games he has played, going 4-for-8 with a double, home run and two RBIs. He was hitting .378 when he went on the injured list and improved that number to .381. \"He stayed mentally into the competition away from the competition,\" manager Mike Shildt said. \"He locked in, did his scouting reports almost every day to keep your mind ready. He took his physical rehab seriously and was able to come back and perform like he has.\" --Field Level Media",

    "content": "May 9 - The Los Angeles Angels and the Baltimore Orioles likely will be happy to see each other on Friday night when they play the first contest of a three-game series in Anaheim, Calif. Both teams have struggled most of the season, and in fact, only the Chicago White Sox have a worse record in the American League. The Orioles come in fresh off a sweep at the hands of the Minnesota Twins, and have lost five in a row overall, including a 5-2 loss on Thursday. It's been a sharp turnaround coming off a season in which they won 91 games and reached the playoffs as a wild card. Dealing with the failure in the moment and figuring out how to fix things going forward is what is going through the minds of the Orioles players. \"I still do believe that it's still early. It's really hard to not be able to go to the playoffs in the first few weeks of the season,\" pitcher Dean Kremer said. \"But guys are taking the losses hard and the wins are awesome, when we get them. Just trying to take it one day at a time and try to keep things as positive as possible.\" Said outfielder Heston Kjerstad: \"None of us are enjoying losing. It definitely takes a toll on us. You show up every day and you want to win, so going home with a loss is never the funnest way to go home.\" Right-hander Tomoyuki Sugano (3-2, 3.00 ERA) will make his eighth start of the season for Baltimore. He's coming off a loss in his last start, but pitched well, allowing two runs and four hits in six innings in a 4-0 setback to the Kansas City Royals. Sugano, who signed a one-year, $13 million contract with the Orioles after 12 seasons in Japan, will be facing the Angels for the first time. Right-hander Kyle Hendricks (1-3, 5.28) will make his seventh start of the season for Los Angeles, coming off his longest start in three years. He gave up one run on four hits and no walks in 7 2/3 innings last Saturday in a victory over the Detroit Tigers. It was the deepest he has pitched in a game since throwing 8 2/3 scoreless innings against the San Diego Padres in a 6-0 victory on May 9, 2022. It also was his first win of the season after signing with the Angels in the off-season. \"I felt much better about the ball coming out, deception stuff, a couple of things we changed mechanically,\" Hendricks said. \"It's just a matter of execution and not tipping (pitches).\" With a fastball that rarely touches 90 mph, Hendricks knows keeping hitters guessing is his path to success. \"He was back-dooring pitches, he used his changeup, he got ahead of them with his breaking stuff, and he was able to recognize when he can shoot that 88 mph fastball,\" Angels manager Ron Washington said of Hendricks' performance last Saturday. \"It looks like he's throwing 98 mph when you know how to pitch, which he does, and things fall into place with his sequencing.\" Hendricks is 1-0 with a 5.14 ERA in two career starts against Baltimore. - Field Level Media",

    "content": "LONDON, May 9 (Reuters Breakingviews) - When UniCredit(CRDI.MI), opens new tabCEO Andrea Orcel snapped up a chunk of Commerzbank(CBKG.DE), opens new tablast September, it seemed like his German target had only one chance of rebuffing a possible takeover: M&A-wary politicians in Berlin. Yet investors are gradually buying into the 28-billion-euro group’s standalone plan under CEO Bettina Orlopp, making the calculus trickier for Orcel. Commerz, which has long struggled to earn a probable cost of equity of around 10%, handily cleared that hurdle in the first quarter of 2025. Results for the first three months of the year,released, opens new tabon Friday, showed an 11.1% return. That’s indicative of a bank that can, at the very least, exist without perpetually destroying shareholder value. Since last September, and particularly following Orlopp’s strategypresentation, opens new taba few months ago, analysts have boosted their medium-term forecasts for the group, including a 13% upgrade to 2026 earnings, using Visible Alpha data. There’s admittedly some froth in the numbers. Euro zone rates are falling, which will hit interest income and therefore earnings: Commerz is pencilling in a less impressive 9.6% return on tangible equity this year, excluding restructuring charges. That suggests Orlopp still has work to do. And operating costs will keep growing under her tenure, analysts reckon, which is awkward given that a combination with UniCredit’s German unit may slash expenses by 1.7 billion euros, according to previous Breakingviews calculations. Still, investors clearly think Orlopp is steering the bank in the right direction. Commerz now trades at 97% of 12-month forward tangible book value, using LSEG Datastream figures, compared with 49% the day before UniCredit disclosed its stake building. Much of the rating increase has happened this year, implying that it relates to the bank’s improved performance rather than bid speculation. The upshot for Orlopp is that she now has two possible lines of defence – financial and political – rather than just the one. In a simple sense, UniCredit wins from Commerz’s rise. Orcel has built up a roughly 28% holding largely through derivatives. His position is heavily hedged to guard against losses, according to a person familiar with the matter, but also allows the Italian lender to capture the upside in its German rival’s share price. The difficulty for Orcel, however, is that Commerz is now inching towards a viable future as an independent group, which means he would have to pay up to snatch it in a possible future takeover, denting the returns on offer. UniCredit also has M&A options at home, but none are straightforward. Orcel’s German deal hunt has been on the backburner for many months, and there’s little hope of that changing if Commerz keeps pleasing its own investors.

    "content": "LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - A UK parliamentary committee endorsed David Kogan to chair a proposed independent football regulator but said on Friday his past links to the ruling Labour Party meant he would have to \"give 110%\" to reassure those in the game about his neutrality. Kogan has had a 45-year career as a media executive, business leader and corporate adviser who has negotiated TV rights deals on behalf of sporting bodies such as the Premier League and English Football League. In 2020, he also made donations to the leadership campaign of Keir Starmer, before he became prime minister, and to parliamentarian Lisa Nandy who is currently the culture secretary. He has also declared being a donor to Labour Party candidates over the past three years. The Culture Media and Sport Committee published a report on Friday endorsing Kogan after a pre-appointment hearing this week. The government last monthannounced Koganas the preferred candidate for the job, which carries a salary of 130,000 pounds ($172,000) for a three-day week. \"While Mr Kogan’s background and experience make him well-suited for the role, his past donations to the Labour Party will inevitably leave him open to charges of political bias in a job where independence is paramount,\" said committee Chair Caroline Dinenage. \"We want to see the new Independent Football Regulator succeed, so it’s crucial that nothing undermines the regulator as it gets up and running. \"Mr Kogan must give 110% when it comes to reassuring everyone in the game that he is his own man.

    "content": "May 9 (Reuters) - British Airways owner IAG(ICAG.L), opens new tabreported better than expected first-quarter profit on Friday and maintained its outlook for 2025, with resilient demand helping to almost triple earnings year on year. Shares were up 2.5% at 1050 GMT, as analysts and investors expressed optimism about IAG's prospects and strategy, bolstered by a strong performance across its British Airways, Aer Lingus and Iberia brands. European airlines in general have delivered strong quarterly results despite global economic uncertainty stoked by U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies. Concern over an economic downturn has cast a shadow over transatlantic routes that have helped to drive IAG's strong results in recent years, but the company's first-quarter statement said that part of the business remained a \"major area of strength\". The company said it was seeing some softness in bookings from the U.S. in the economy cabin, but that was being offset by strength in premium bookings. Chief Executive Luis Gallego told reporters that bookings to South America in particular were very strong, with Europe and Africa also robust. IAG also announced anew orderfor Boeing and Airbus jets, a day after Britain and the United States announced a trade deal. Gallego said IAG had been working on the deal \"for a long time\". Davy Research analyst Stephen Furlong called the results \"decent\" and said IAG's aircraft order was \"a positive longer term sign\". European peersAir France-KLM(AIRF.PA), opens new tabandLufthansa(LHAG.DE), opens new tablast week cautioned about potential economic headwinds but did not declare any notable impact on business so far. U.S. airlines such asDelta(DAL.N), opens new tabpulled their financial forecasts in April on the back of demand uncertainty resulting from Trump's tariffs. Virgin Atlantic also said it had noticed a slowdown in travel from the United States to Britain. IAG reported operating earnings of 198 million euros ($222 million) for the three months to March 31, against 68 million euros a year earlier and analysts' consensus estimate of 158 million euros, as compiled by the company. IAG shares bucked the wider sector trend by performing well last year as its transatlantic advantage helped to bolster investor confidence. They reached a five-year high in February before drifting lower, but they have been climbing again since early April. Gallego told reporters it was too early to tell if demand on transatlantic routes would soften in later quarters. \"With 80% of flights for the second quarter already booked, the outlook is brighter than many expected,\" Aarin Chiekrie, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said in a note. \"After such a strong start to the year and demand holding up well, there could be room for markets to turn more positive on IAG and the industry as a whole.\" Other analysts sounded more cautious, particularly for the second half of the year, given lower bookings at 29% for the third quarter. \"We expect profits in this (the third) quarter to be vulnerable to Atlantic unit revenues, despite the tailwind from fuel,\" Barclays said in a note. The first quarter is often the weakest for airlines, which rely heavily on the busy summer travel season. ($1 = 0.8902 euros)",

Today's Market Minute * Behind closed doors, Chinese officials have grown increasingly alarmed about the U.S. tariffs' impact on their economy and the risk of isolation asChina's trading partners have started negotiating deals with Washington. * From his first moments on the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica, Pope Leo XIV gave three important clues about whatkind of leader of the 1.4-billion-member Catholic Church he will be. * U.S. President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday announced a limited bilateral trade agreement that leaves in place Trump's 10% tariffs on British exports,modestly expands agricultural access for both countries and lowers prohibitive U.S. duties on British car exports. * While many investors survived the market volatility unleashed by U.S. President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" with only a few scratches, macro hedge funds suffered one of their worst maulings in years.Check out the latest from Reuters' columnist Jamie McGeever. * Forget April, it’s this summer that could prove decisive as investors seek to determine if this shift is a short-term move or a true secular change in market leadership.Read the analysis from TPW founder Jay Pelosky. Tariff rollback hopes rising World markets have latched onto the prospect of a gradual rollback of U.S. tariffs to extend their recent recovery from April's trade shock. Even though it appears theuniversal 10% leviesleveled on all countries' imports to America will remain regardless of bilateral talks underway, there is still some optimism that many of the more extreme 'reciprocal' tariffs may be negotiated away. Britain's tradedeal with Washington on Thursday encouragedthose hopes, and investors will be paying close attention to theU.S.-China talksset to begin in Switzerland this weekend. Wall Street rallied again on Thursday, with thedollar .DXY surgingto its best levels in a month and U.S. Treasury yields hitting their highest in two weeks. Oil prices gained, the VIX 'fear index' ebbed to the lowest since April 2 andBitcoinrecaptured the $100,000 level to hit its highest since January.

But ahead of the weekend talks in Switzerland, China reported asurprisingly big beatin worldwide exports for April as demand from countries seeking to capitalise on the 90-day tariff pause offset a 21% drop in Beijing's bilateral exports to America. Even that decline in exports to the United States surprised forecasters, who had expected a greater drop given the 145% direct tariffs imposed on China. This suggests many U.S. importers couldn't switch suppliers easily and may have to pass on the higher costs to consumers. This could spur worries about rising consumer prices and put upward pressure on Treasury yields. Friday's diary sees a parade of top Federal Reserve officials speaking following this week's Fed decision to hold policy rates steady as the central bank waits to see how the trade and inflation picture pans out. April inflation updates are due next week. President Donald Trump wasted little time in resuming his stinging criticism ofFed Chair Jerome Powellon Thursday, calling him a \"fool\" for not lowering interest rates. Vice President JD Vance added to the attacks, saying Powell has \"been wrong about almost everything.\" Thursday's $25 billion sale of 30-year Treasury bonds jarred in the backdrop. The auction's 2.31 bid-to-cover ratio, a gauge of demand, was the lowest since July 2024 and the 58.9% awarded to indirect bidders, which include foreign investors, was the lowest since 2019.

But key parts of the trade deal, particularly how it sidestepped any compromise on food standards, will allow Britain to more easily engage in parallel negotiations with the European Union this month.

Chart of the day Trade talks between the world's two largest economies will begin in Switzerland this weekend. Ahead of those talks, China reported that its exports in April were far ahead of forecasts despite the imposition of 145% U.S. tariffs. The unexpected buoyancy partly reflected demand for materials from overseas manufacturers who rushed to send out goods in order to make the most of 90-day tariff pause. However, China's direct exports to the U.S. fell 21%, which means the trade surplus with the U.S. dropped to $20.5 billion from $27.6 billion in March.

    "content": "LISBON, May 9 (Reuters) - Portugal's governing centre-right Democratic Alliance (AD) kept its lead in a new opinion poll released on Friday ahead of a May 18 national election, though it was seen falling short of a majority in a parliament that looks set to remain fragmented. The ICS/ISCTE survey published by Expresso newspaper showed the AD - which came to power in a snap election last year - dropping to 32% support from 33% two weeks ago. However, their main rivals, the centre-left Socialists, also fell, to 27% from 29%. It leaves the AD far from a parliamentary majority, which under Portugal's proportional representation system could only be achieved with at least 42% of the vote. The March 2024 election saw the AD and the Socialists finish neck-and-neck with 28% and 27% of the vote, respectively, which led to a minority AD government.

The recommendation also includes a possibility to extend an initial five-year spectrum allocation by a further two years depending on market conditions, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI)said. The telecom watchdog also recommended charging telecom operators 4% of their adjusted gross revenue for geostationary orbit-based fixed satellite services and for mobile satellite services. This is subject to a minimum annual spectrum charge of 3,500 rupees ($41) per megahertz (MHz), according to TRAI. For non-geostationary orbit-based fixed satellite services, an additional 500 rupees per subscriber per annum in urban areas should be charged, exempting rural and remote areas, it said. The recommendations come as Elon Musk is working towards launching Starlink in India. Musk has urged New Delhi to allot spectrum for 20 years to focus on \"affordable pricing and longer-term business plans,\" according to Starlink's public submissions. TRAI had agreed to demands for alower licence time-frameto see how the sector grows, Reuters had reported in March, citing a government source.
